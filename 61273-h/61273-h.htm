<p class="f150"><b>PREFACE.</b></p>

<p>One of the most encouraging of recent educational movements is the
increasing importance attached, both in this country and abroad,
to what is called Nature-Study. It is evident that the instruction
contemplated differs as widely, on the one hand, from the traditional
object-lessons on polar bears and ironclads, as it differs from formal
Biology on the other. This difference is abundantly shown, not only
by the circulars and syllabuses issued by our own Board of Education,
but by the publications of the leading educational authorities of
Europe and America. The aim of Nature-Study, as thus laid down, is not
primarily the acquisition of the facts of natural history: it is rather
a training in methods of open-eyed, close, and accurate observation,
especially of familiar animals and plants, which shall teach the
student to <i>see</i> what he looks at, and to <i>think about</i> what he sees.</p>

<p>It is in a spirit of entire agreement with these views that this book
has been written. No previous knowledge of Biology on the part of the
reader is assumed, and technical terms have as far as possible been
dispensed with. In drawing up the course, I have had in mind throughout
the attitude of an intelligent youth of sixteen, and the work will be
found to be well within the powers of such a student. Teachers will,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
however, find no difficulty in adapting the exercises to the needs of
younger pupils.</p>

<p>Care has been taken to select, as types for study, animals and plants
which are at the same time representative and easily obtainable,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and I have been further guided in the selection by the Board of Education
Syllabuses of the King’s Scholarship Examination and Section I. of
the Elementary Stage of General Biology, the subjects of which are
included in the volume. The book has, however, a considerably wider
scope than is indicated in these syllabuses, and will therefore, I
hope, be found useful not only in schools and training-colleges, and
to examination candidates, but also to members of field clubs and to
students of natural history generally. It has been necessary to arrange
the chapters with some attempt at logical sequence, but it is not
supposed that this order will be adhered to in practice; by the aid of
the monthly nature-calendar, together with numerous cross-references,
it will be found easy to take up the work at any point.</p>

<p>The chapters are divided into sections, each of which consists of
two parts: First, precise instructions for practical observations
and experiments, designed to exercise the reasoning faculties of the
students; and, second, a descriptive portion, in which the meaning and
relation of the results obtained are discussed. At the end of each
chapter is a number of additional exercises, either original or taken
from past examination papers. Of the latter class, questions to which
dates are affixed have been set by the Board of Education, while those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
marked “N.F.U.” are selected from National Froebel Union tests. In
many cases, the exercises provide subjects for further observation and
experiment, as well as for written description.</p>

<p>Much trouble has been taken in the selection of the illustrations,
many of which have been expressly drawn or photographed for this book.
Through the kindness of the publishers I have been able to include
illustrations from Strasburger’s <i>Text-Book of Botany</i>, Parker and
Haswell’s <i>Text-Book of Zoology</i>, <i>The Cambridge Natural History</i>, and
other books; and Mr. Ernest Evans has courteously consented to the use
of a number of figures from his <i>Botany for Beginners</i>. The following
illustrations have been prepared from photographs supplied by Mr. J.
C. Shenstone, F.L.S., Vice-President of the Essex Field Club: Figs.

are reproduced, by permission, from Pike’s <i>Woodland, Field, and Shore</i>
(Religious Tract Society).</p>

<p>Finally, I must acknowledge gratefully the continuous help which,
at every stage in the preparation of the book, I have received from
Professor R. A. Gregory and Mr. A. T. Simmons, B.Sc.—help as valuable
as it was generous.</p>

<p>The issue of a new edition has provided the opportunity of adding a
section on School Journeys, originally contributed by me as an article
to <i>The School World</i>, and reprinted here by kind permission of the
Editors of that journal. For the illustrative sketch-map (<a href="#FIG_237">Fig. 237</a>),
and for Figs. <a href="#FIG_19">19</a>, <a href="#FIG_21">21</a> and <a href="#FIG_138">138</a>,
I am indebted to my friend Mr. T. D. Tuton Hall.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">SEEDS AND THEIR EARLY STAGES OF GROWTH.</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class="space-above2">1. THE STRUCTURE OF SEEDS WITH TWO COTYLEDONS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Preparation of the seeds.</b>—Obtain several seeds of the broad
bean, pea, mustard, yellow lupine, vegetable marrow, and sycamore; soak
them in cold or slightly warm water until they are soft enough to be
cut through easily with a sharp knife. The time necessary will vary
with different seeds according to the size of the seeds, and with the
temperature of the water. The beans should be left in the water for a
few days. When the seeds are soft enough, examine one or two of each,
and in the meantime put about six of each (except the mustard) in damp
sawdust in a warm place. Put the mustard seeds on damp flannel in a saucer.</p>

<p>2. <b>The outside of a broad bean.</b>—Notice the flattened oval
shape, with an indentation at one place (<a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>). What is the colour
of the skin (<i>seed-coat</i>) of the bean seed? Is all the skin of this
colour? A black <i>scar</i> extends along the edge from the indentation for
about ¾ in. What is this scar? If beans in the pod can be obtained,
see that the scar is the place of attachment of the seed stalk. Make
drawings to scale, showing side and edge-views of the seed. Wipe the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
bean dry and then squeeze it gently. Notice that a drop of water comes
out at a point at one end of the stalk scar. There is evidently a
little hole here. This little hole is called the <i>micropyle</i>. Mark
its position by a dot on the drawing.</p>

<p>3. <b>The inside of a broad bean.</b>—With a sharp knife cut the
seed-coat open, beginning at the side of the seed furthest from the
micropyle, and carefully remove the seed-coat. Notice that near the
micropyle the seed-coat forms a funnel-shaped depression, and that the
point of the funnel is at the micropyle. Does anything fit into the
funnel? A little cone may be seen to fill the funnel; this conical body
is called the <i>radicle</i>. Make a drawing of the seed after the removal
of the seed-coat. Look at the edge opposite the radicle and notice that
a crack divides the body of the seed into halves. Put the point of your
knife blade into the crack, and gently force the halves apart. They
come apart without tearing, showing that they are naturally separate,
although they fit so closely together.</p>

<p>These two swollen bodies are called the <i>cotyledons</i>. Separate them
and see, at the point where they join the radicle, a little curved
rod, evidently a continuation of the radicle, lying between them. This
rod is the <i>plumule</i>. Take off one cotyledon, and make a drawing of
the inner face of the other cotyledon, with the adhering plumule and
radicle (<a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>4. <b>Starch present in the cotyledons of the bean.</b>—Scrape the
inner surface of a cotyledon and then pour on it a drop of iodine
solution.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Is there any change? Pour also a drop of iodine solution on a piece
of laundry-starch. Is a similar blue colour formed? What substance is
probably present in the cotyledons of the bean?</p>

<p>5. <b>The pea.</b>—Examine a pea in a similar manner. Make drawings
showing the <i>stalk-scar</i>, the <i>micropyle</i>, and the <i>plumule</i> and
<i>radicle</i> with their manner of connection with the <i>cotyledons</i>. Does
the end of the radicle point towards the micropyle? How many cotyledons
has this seed? What shape and colour are they? Do they contain starch?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <b>The seed of the yellow lupine.</b>—Compare this with the bean
and the pea, and find out how many cotyledons it has, and whether
they contain starch. Can you find the plumule? It is very small, but
occupies a position similar to that of the plumule of the bean. Does
the end of the radicle point to the micropyle?</p>

<p>7. <b>The vegetable marrow seed.</b>—Notice the peculiar shape
(somewhat like a pocket-flask) of the seed, and the thickened margin
which runs round it. Carefully cut the seed-coat away so as not to
injure the part inside. How many cotyledons are present? What is their
colour? Do they contain starch? Can you see the plumule and radicle
clearly? If not, do not decide that they are absent, but leave the
question to be settled later, when you watch a vegetable marrow seed
“come up.”</p>

<p>8. <b>The mustard seed.</b>—Notice how much smaller this seed is than
the others. With a balance, find how many mustard seeds are equal in
weight to one bean seed. Observe the stickiness of the seed-coat of
the soaked seed, and then remove it carefully with needles, exposing
two thin plates, each one folded on itself, and one tucked inside the
other, like two sheets of note-paper. These are the cotyledons; it
seems that the smallness of the seed may be mainly due to the small
size of the cotyledons. What is their colour? Remember these characters
and try, when you watch the young plants come up later, to find an
explanation of them.</p>

<p>9. <b>The sycamore fruit.</b>—The seed of the sycamore is enclosed
in a case which has a wing attached to it. The wing, the case, and
the enclosed seed together constitute the <i>fruit</i> of the sycamore.
The fruits occur in pairs (<a href="#FIG_137">Fig. 137</a>). Notice that a cord runs out to
each fruit from the stalk on which the pair of fruits is borne. Make a
drawing of a pair of fruits, then separate the fruits.</p>

<p>10. <b>The sycamore seed.</b>—Cut open a fruit. Can you see anything
between the seed and the fruit-case? Would the hairy covering of the
seed tend to keep it warm during the winter? Why? Why do you prefer to
wear flannel in winter and linen in summer? Flannel is more fluffy than linen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Remove the seed-coat carefully. Running down one side you will see
a little curved rod. This is the radicle. Gently raise it with the
point of your knife. Notice that the rest of the seed seems to consist
of a green part, which is curled up. Uncoil the curls carefully. You
find that they are two green leaves, fixed at the top of the radicle.
These are the cotyledons. In the seed each cotyledon is first folded
in two across the middle and then coiled up. Make a sketch showing the
coils (<a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>). Can you see the plumule? It is just at the top of the
radicle, where the cotyledons are fixed on.</p>

<p><b>Plants are living things.</b>—One of our foremost naturalists<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
tells us that when he goes out into the woods, or into one of those
fairy forests which we call fields, he finds himself welcomed by a glad
company of friends, everyone with something interesting to tell. Such a
feeling would be quite impossible to one who did not vividly recognise
the fact that plants are alive; for it is precisely this recognition
or its absence which makes the observation of the forms and habits of
plants fascinating or the reverse. Let the Nature-Student, then, at
the outset of his work, keep the idea of <b>life</b> inseparably bound
up with his every thought about plants. It may at first require a
little effort, but before long it will enable him to understand how the
friendship of the more silent half of animate nature may form one of
the great pleasures of life.</p>

<p><b>The study of seeds.</b>—The manifestation of life is so striking,
and the changes in form and size take place so rapidly, in the
germination of seeds, that the study of plants cannot better be
commenced than with this stage of their growth. The method has also the
logical virtue of beginning at the beginning, or nearly so.</p>

<p>These early changes can be well observed by taking various common
seeds, soaking them in water until they are soft, and then allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
them to germinate in damp sawdust, taking a few out at intervals
and noting their progress. The growth of the seeds takes place more
rapidly if they are kept in a warm room, but in any case some days will
probably elapse before much change is noticeable in them.</p>

<p>During the interval of waiting, some of the seeds themselves should
be carefully examined, and <b>drawings</b> of all the parts should be
made. The drawing ought on no account to be omitted. It compels the
student’s attention to details which would otherwise pass unnoticed;
and a careful sketch is a much better record of an observation than
any amount of description alone could be. The drawing need not be
elaborate; an outline pencil-sketch to scale will usually be sufficient.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The seed of the broad bean.</b>—The seed of the broad bean (<a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>)
is large, having a diameter of perhaps an inch and a half, and a
thickness of half an inch. In shape it is oval, but at one region
the edge is indented, and a black scar (<i>st. sc.</i>) runs from the
indentation along the edge for a distance of about three-quarters
of an inch. This scar is the place of attachment of the stalk which
formerly carried the seed in the bean-fruit (pod). It may be called
the <b>stalk-scar</b>. If a soaked bean is wiped dry and then gently
squeezed, a small drop of water escapes from the end of the stalk-scar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
nearest the indentation. The hole out of which the water comes is very
small and difficult to see, but its position is thus made clear. This
hole (<i>m</i>) is called the <b>micropyle</b>,—a word meaning the “little gate.”</p>

<p>The bean seed is covered by a tough brown skin, the <b>seed-coat</b>
(<a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>, <i>s.c.</i>), a funnel-shaped depression in which leads
to the micropyle (<i>m</i>). The depression is occupied by a part of the seed which
is shaped like a conical peg and called the <b>radicle</b> (<i>R</i>); the
point of the radicle is directed toward the micropyle. The great body
of the seed is composed of two fleshy, cream-coloured lobes, easily
wedged apart by inserting a knife-blade between them; these fleshy
lobes are the <b>cotyledons</b> (<i>Cot.</i>). Between them, and continuous
with the radicle, is a small yellow body, the <b>plumule</b> (<i>pl.</i>).
The relations of the radicle, plumule and cotyledons are best seen by
removing one cotyledon (<a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The seed of the pea.</b>—Except in size and shape the seed of the
pea is very similar to the bean seed. Its form is spherical, and the
scar left by the stalk which formerly attached it to the wall of the
pea-pod (<a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>) is plainly to be seen. Pointing towards the micropyle
is the peg-like radicle; the plumule lies between the hemispherical
cotyledons. As before, the cotyledons can be proved to contain starch,
by the blue colour which is formed when a drop of iodine solution is
poured on the scraped surface.</p>

<p><b>The seed of the yellow lupine.</b>—The seed of the yellow lupine
is about as large as a pea, but it is slightly flattened in shape. The
seed-coat is prettily mottled; when it is removed, the greater part
of the seed is found to consist of two cotyledons. They are somewhat
swollen, but the stored food is not starch. The plumule and radicle
occupy positions similar to those of the bean and pea.</p>

<p><b>The vegetable marrow seed.</b>—This seed has a rather curious
shape, and somewhat resembles a pocket-flask. It is flattened, and
the border of the seed-coat is thickened and of silky appearance, the
rest of the “skin” having some resemblance to kid. The two cotyledons,
which compose the greater part of the seed, are white and only slightly
fleshy. The plumule and radicle are at the pointed end of the seed, and
are difficult to see.</p>

<p><b>The mustard seed.</b>—In comparing the mustard seed with those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
already described, one is struck with the great difference in size. An
average broad-bean seed weighs about 600 times as much as the mustard
seed. While the two fleshy cotyledons make up the bulk of the seed
of the bean, pea, lupine and vegetable marrow, the cotyledons of the
mustard seed are thin and leaf-like. They are folded on themselves, one
inside the other (as at <i>g</i>, <a href="#FIG_61">Fig. 61</a>), and enclose the radicle. The
characters of the cotyledons account very largely for the small size of
the mustard seed. It will be seen, when the growth of the young plants
is watched, that the difference is associated with the special duties
which the cotyledons perform in the various cases.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The sycamore seed.</b>—What is generally called the seed of the
sycamore is really a <b>fruit</b>. The fruits are in pairs
(Figs. <a href="#FIG_33"> 33</a> and <a href="#FIG_137"> 137</a>), and each half
consists of a flat wing and a rounded case in which the seed itself is enclosed. The round seed-cases of the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
fruits are connected together. When they come apart, a scar marks the
place where they were formerly in contact, and a little cord runs out
to each fruit from the stalk on which the pair of fruits is borne.</p>

<p>Between the sycamore seed and the wall of its case is a layer of fine
hair (<i>h</i>, <a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>), which forms a warm nest for the seed in
winter. The seed is surrounded by a thin, brown seed-coat, and consists mainly of
two cotyledons, but these are very different from any yet described.
Each is a green leaf, measuring, when unfolded, about an inch in
length. It is first folded across the middle of its length, and then
rolled up into a close coil with its fellow. The coils are very plainly
to be seen when the seed coat is removed, or when the whole seed is
cut through, by a sharp knife, in the plane of the wing. Running down
one side of the seed is a green rod, the radicle (<i>R</i>, <a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>). The
two cotyledons (<i>cot. 1</i> and <i>cot. 2</i>) spring from its upper end,
and between them is the tiny plumule (<i>pl.</i>)</p>

<p>The sycamore seed bears more resemblance to the mustard seed than to
the others, but it is on a much larger scale. In each of these two
seeds the cotyledons are plainly leaves, while in the others their
nature is disguised by the great accumulation of stored food in them.</p>

<h4>2. THE EARLY STAGES OF GROWTH OF SEEDS WITH TWO COTYLEDONS.</h4>

<p>If the seeds which were sown in damp sawdust and on flannel are kept
warm they will soon be ready for study. You should remember that at
present your object is not so much to rear the plants as to find out
<i>how</i> they grow. As soon, therefore, as any sign of growth is to be
seen when you take a seed out, you should begin to examine them at
regular intervals, taking one or two out every day and leaving the rest
to continue their development. Keep the sawdust damp, but not wet.</p>

<p>1. <b>The pea and bean.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>General development.</i>—Very soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the seed-coat splits at the micropyle-end of the stalk-scar, and
the end of the radicle protrudes. Does the radicle grow upwards or
downwards? Observe that even if the seed was so planted that the
micropyle was at the top, the radicle turns over and grows straight
down. Turn over a seedling and see if you can persuade the radicle to
grow upwards. Open a seed when the radicle is about an inch long, and
see what the plumule is doing. It is still enclosed in the seed-coat,
and lies between the cotyledons, but is larger than at first. As the
growth proceeds the cotyledons begin to separate near the top of the
radicle, and you can get a glimpse of the plumule.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The growth of the radicle.</i>—Day by day the radicle becomes
longer. Is it <i>all</i> growing longer, or does the increase in length take
place more at one part than another? To answer this question, take five
or six inches of cotton thread and moisten the middle part with Indian
ink. Lay the seed on a flat ruler, so that the radicle lies over an
inch divided into—say—tenths. Hold the thread tight, and press the
inked part gently on the radicle, making about five marks at equal
intervals from the point upwards. The ink will dry almost immediately.
Then carefully replant the seed, taking care not to injure the radicle.
After a few days take it out again, lay it once more on the ruler, and
measure the distance between the marks.</p>

<p><i>The radicle is evidently the young root.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The root-cap.</i>—Hold up the radicle to the light, and examine
its tip with a lens. Try to see that the tip is covered by a little
cap, somewhat like a very small thimble. This is called the <i>root-cap</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The root-hairs.</i>—Hold a seed, with the radicle about an inch
long, against a dark surface. Is the surface of the radicle smooth, or
can you see any fluffiness on it? Is all the radicle fluffy, or only a
part? Which part? As you examine older and older seedlings notice how
much of the radicle is fluffy, and where the fluffy part is. The fluffy
appearance is caused by fine, closely-set hairs, called <i>root-hairs</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The plumule.</i>—How soon after planting does the plumule become
free? Does it grow upwards or downwards? <i>The plumule is evidently the
young stem.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
As soon as the young stem is old enough mark it with Indian ink as
you marked the young root, and replant it to find if there is any
difference in the rates of growth of its different parts.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>The fate of the cotyledons.</i>—From time to time examine the
cotyledons and notice that as the seedling grows larger they become
more and more shrunken. Something is evidently being taken from them,
perhaps to feed the young plant. We shall inquire into this by further
experiment (<a href="#Page_26">Chapter II.</a>).</p>

<p>Do the cotyledons remain in their original position, or are they
carried upwards with the growing stem or downwards with the growing root?</p>

<p>2. <b>The yellow lupine.</b>—In the same way observe how this seed
grows. Do the cotyledons shift their position or change in colour? Do
they become leaf-like? How do they differ from later-formed leaves?
What becomes of them at last? What becomes of the seed-coat?</p>

<p>3. <b>The mustard seed.</b>—Notice that, soon after the radicle has
come out of the seed-coat, a sort of hump forms at its upper end, and
at length the cotyledons are pulled out of the seed-coat and turn
up towards the light. What is their colour? Observe that the two
cotyledons are soon raised on the end of a little stalk. Like the
cotyledons of the yellow lupine they are plainly leaves. Notice their
shape. Are they of equal size? Why not? When they are about three
inches above the seed-coat gently separate them and notice the little
bud between them. Draw the seedling. How large can you get a mustard
seedling to grow on damp flannel? Plant a few mustard seeds on earth,
and notice the difference between the shape of the cotyledons or
seed-leaves and that of the leaves which appear later. What becomes of
the cotyledons?</p>

<p>4. <b>The vegetable marrow seed.</b>—Make similar observations
upon the vegetable marrow seeds, noticing particularly whether the
cotyledons remain in their original positions and shrink up as the
plant increases in size, or whether they are pulled out of the
seed-coat by the elongating stem, and become green and leafy. How does
the plant hold down its seed-coat whilst it pulls out its cotyledons?</p>

<p>5. <b>The sycamore seed.</b>—From what you have seen of the cotyledons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of the sycamore seed, will you expect them to behave like those of the
mustard seed, or like those of the pea and bean? Even in the seed they
are green, and plainly leaves. How do they escape from the seed-coat?
What is their shape? Do they come out before or after the radicle? Do
they get any larger as the stem grows? How large can you get a sycamore
seedling to grow in damp sawdust? As large as a seedling of pea or
bean? Plant some sycamore seeds on earth and compare the shape of the
cotyledons with that of the next-formed leaves. How soon do the “true”
leaves appear after the cotyledons have escaped from the seed? Do
any “true” leaves grow on the plants in sawdust? What becomes of the
cotyledons at last?</p>

<p><b>The embryo.</b>—The plumule, radicle, and cotyledons, which have
now been seen in the seed, form the <b>embryo</b> of the plant. The
adult plant will be wholly formed by the growth and development of
these parts, and we must now follow carefully the changes which take
place when the seed germinates, and try to find out what becomes of
each part. It is better to put the seeds at first in damp sawdust
rather than in earth, as the young roots can then be more readily
cleaned and observed. With small seeds the early stages of growth are
better seen if damp flannel is used.</p>

<p><b>Germination.</b>—Under the influence of moisture and warmth the
embryo in the seed begins to swell and unfold its parts. The radicle
makes its appearance first (<a href="#FIG_5-6">Fig. 5</a>), breaking through the seed-coat
at the micropyle; it is the young root. The radicle always grows
downwards, that is, toward the centre of the earth. If the seed lies in
such a position that the micropyle is directed upwards, the point of
the radicle turns over and grows downwards as soon as it escapes from
the seed-coat. As the young root becomes longer and thicker (<a href="#FIG_5-6">Fig. 6</a>)
the seed-coat opens more and more, showing the cotyledons beneath, and
these, too, are gradually forced apart.

</div>

<p><b>The cotyledons.</b>—During the germination of various seeds, a very
marked difference in the behaviour of the cotyledons is to be seen.
In the case of the <b>broad bean and pea</b> the cotyledons remain in
their original positions, partially enclosed by the split seed-coat.
Presently a hump (Figs.<a href="#FIG_5-6"> 6</a> and <a href="#FIG_10-11"> 11</a>) forms at
the upper end of the radicle, as if the plant were making an effort to pull its plumule out
of the seed. It soon succeeds (<a href="#FIG_12-13">Fig. 12</a>), and the plumule turns up to
the light. It is the young stem. At its end is a little bud, formed by
a number of small, overlapping, green leaves which surround the growing
point. Henceforth the stem grows upwards, that is in a direction
precisely opposite to that of the root’s growth. Both stem and root are
attached to the cotyledons, which gradually shrivel up as the stem and
root become larger and larger.</p>

<p>When, however, the seed of the <b>mustard</b>, or <b>sycamore</b>,
germinates the cotyledons behave very differently (Figs.<a href="#FIG_7"> 7</a>
 and <a href="#FIG_8"> 8</a>). Soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
after the root has become well established the cotyledons come quite
out of the seed-coat and unfold themselves. Instead of remaining on or
under the surface of the ground they are carried upwards at the end of
a stalk toward the light, and for some time the little plant appears
to consist of root, stalk, and cotyledons only. If, however, the
cotyledons are gently pressed apart, a tiny bud is seen between them.
This evidently corresponds to the bud at the end of the stem of the
bean or pea.</p>

<p>In the case of the <b>lupine</b> (<a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>) or <b>vegetable marrow</b>
(<a href="#FIG_10-11">Fig. 10</a>) the cotyledons appear to combine these two conditions. They
are swollen and contain stored food; yet they come out of the seed-coat
early, become green, and open out to the light. They are evidently
leaves, though their shape differs from that of the later leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
The germinating vegetable-marrow seed possesses a curious contrivance
for pulling its cotyledons out of the seed-coat. This is a peg (<i>p</i>,
<a href="#FIG_10-11">Fig. 10</a>) which develops at the top of the radicle, and holds down the
lower half of the seed-coat whilst the other half is forced upwards to
allow the cotyledons to be withdrawn.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

            out; the first foliage leaves have not yet unfolded. On the left, the
            first two foliage leaves are unfolding, and the cotyledons have spread
            out flat. (Slightly reduced.)</p>
</div>

<p>After a little thought a possible explanation of these differences
in the cotyledons suggests itself. It may be that, in the case of
the mustard and sycamore, leaves are required as early as possible,
while the bean and pea have no immediate need for leaves because their
cotyledons contain so much stored food. The cotyledons of these plants
shrivel up as the seedling grows, and this seems to indicate that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
during its early stages the plant lives upon this food. In <a href="#Page_26">Chapter II.</a>
we shall make experiments to see if this explanation is the true one.
If so, the lupine and vegetable-marrow seeds evidently rely partly upon
their stored food and partly upon setting the cotyledons to work as
leaves, whilst the plant is still very young.</p>

<p><b>The true leaves.</b>—The cotyledons are really <b>makeshift
leaves</b>, which are already formed in the seeds. Even when they
expand and become green they do not live long, but as soon as the next
few leaves are well established, shrivel up and wither. The true or
“foliage” leaves first make their appearance as a bud which surrounds
the growing point of the stem. As this part of the stem increases in
length, the foliage leaves become separated from each other and spread
out to the light and air.</p>

<p><b>The lengthening of the stem and root.</b>—Unless an experiment to
test the truth of the matter is really made, it might be supposed that
the different parts of the stem and root of the seedling grow in length
at the same rate. This can be tested by marking the stem and root
with lines of Indian ink at equal distances. In one experiment with
a pea seedling five lines were marked upon the young root at regular
intervals of one-tenth of an inch, beginning at the tip (<a href="#FIG_10-11">Fig. 11</a>).
The seedling was carefully replanted and examined again a few days later.
Between the tip and the first mark there was then (<a href="#FIG_12-13">Fig. 12</a>)
a distance of seven-tenths of an inch; that is, this part had grown to seven
times its former length. The second interval was four times as long as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
before, the third was one and a half times as long, while the
fourth and fifth intervals had not increased in length at all. Such
experiments prove that the root grows in length either at or just
behind the tip. When a young stem is treated in the same way the
lengthening is found to take place more evenly.</p>

<p><b>Rootlets.</b>—After a time the radicle begins to put out branches
called <b>rootlets</b>. These come off the main root in rows. In some
cases rootlets make their appearance whilst the radicle is still very
short, as in the vegetable marrow of <a href="#FIG_10-11">Fig. 10</a>, but in others the radicle
may be a few inches long before it produces rootlets.</p>

<p><b>The root cap.</b>—The tip of the root, and of each of its branches,
is covered by a little cap, shaped somewhat like a thimble (<a href="#FIG_12-13">Fig. 13</a>).
This protects the tender growing point from the friction of particles
of soil, and is continually renewed by growth from within as its outer
layers are worn away.</p>

<p><b>Root hairs.</b>—When a young root is held against a dark background
it appears fluffy. This appearance is caused by a large number of very
fine hairs upon its surface. The hairs are not found all over the root
and its branches, but only for a short distance a little way behind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
tips (Figs. <a href="#FIG_7"> 7</a> and <a href="#FIG_10-11"> 11</a>). These
root hairs are of very great importance to the plant, as will be seen in
<a href="#Page_26">Chapter II.</a></p>

<h4>3. THE STRUCTURE OF GRAINS OF<br /> MAIZE AND WHEAT.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Preparation of the seeds.</b>—Soak grains of maize (Indian corn)
and wheat in water until they are soft. The grains of maize will need
soaking for several days. Plant about a dozen of each in damp sawdust,
and in the meantime examine others.</p>

<p>2. <b>The maize grain.</b>—A grain of maize is really a fruit,
as a pea-pod is. A pea-pod contains several seeds; a maize fruit
contains only one seed, which fills it. Notice the shape of the
grain—flattened, rounded along one edge, and bluntly pointed at the
opposite edge (<a href="#FIG_14-15">Fig. 14</a>). Notice a whitish patch on one of the flattened
sides; a ridge (<i>E</i>) down the middle of this marks the position of
the <i>embryo</i>. Cut through the grain lengthwise, so as to divide the
<i>embryo</i> into two equal parts, and examine the cut surface (<a href="#FIG_14-15">Fig. 15</a>).
Identify:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) The <i>embryo</i>, lying somewhat obliquely, and to one side. The
radicle (<i>rad.</i>) is directed towards the pointed end of the grain, and
the plumule (<i>pl.</i>) towards the rounded end.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <i>endosperm</i> (<i>end</i>): a mass of material outside the embryo,
and forming at least half of the grain.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The <i>scutellum</i> (<i>scm</i>): a plate lying between the endosperm and
the embryo.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The <i>coats</i> of the seed and fruit, surrounding the whole.</p>
</div>

<p>Draw. Add a drop of iodine solution to the cut surface of the
half-grain. The endosperm turns blue. What does this indicate?</p>

<p>3. <b>The wheat grain.</b>—A grain of wheat is also a one-seeded
fruit. Notice the groove along one side, and—on the opposite side
near one end—the white patch marking the position of the embryo. At
the other end is a tuft of very fine hairs. Cut the grain lengthwise,
so as to divide the white patch into two equal parts, and make out the
embryo, endosperm, and scutellum (<a href="#FIG_16">Fig. 16</a>). Draw. Test the endosperm
with iodine solution. Does it contain starch?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Grains of maize and wheat.</b>—A grain of maize or wheat is really
a one-seeded fruit. In other words, the grain consists not only of the
seed with its seed-coat, but also of the seed-case. In this respect it
resembles the fruit of the sycamore (<a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>). When, however,
a grain of maize or wheat is carefully examined, it is found to differ greatly
from all the seeds hitherto mentioned. A <b>maize grain</b> is somewhat
flattened, and rather pointed along one edge (<a href="#FIG_14-15">Fig. 14</a>).
On one flat side, near the pointed end, may be seen a whitish patch, and, along
the middle line of this, a ridge which marks the position of the <i>embryo</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>A <b>wheat grain</b> has a different shape. It is oval, with a deep
groove running down one side. One end is clothed with a tuft of very
fine hairs; near the other end, on the side opposite to the groove, is
a white patch beneath which is the embryo.</p>

<p>These differences in shape are of small importance, for the two grains
are really of very similar structure, as may be seen when they are cut
through lengthwise with a sharp knife, in a direction which divides the
embryo along its middle line. It is then plain that each grain consists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of two principal parts: the embryo and the endosperm (Figs. <a href="#FIG_14-15"> 15</a>
and <a href="#FIG_16"> 16</a>). The <b>embryo</b> lies to one side and in the lower
half of the seed. At its upper end the young stem and at its lower end the young
root—each still enclosed in protecting sheaths—are easily seen. The
greater part of the seed is quite outside the embryo; it is a mass of
food called the <b>endosperm</b>, which has been stored up for the use
of the young plant during its earliest stages of germination. This food
mass at once turns blue when a drop of iodine solution is placed upon
it, showing that it contains a considerable amount of starch. It is the
endosperm which is made into flour when corn is ground.</p>

<p>Lying between the embryo and endosperm is a flat plate called the
<b>scutellum</b>. Covering embryo, scutellum, and endosperm is the seed-coat
proper, and outside that come the various layers of the fruit case.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

                      through the middle line of a wheat grain.</p>
</div>

<p>In the seeds previously examined, the embryo—consisting of plumule,
radicle, and cotyledons—was seen to fill the seed-coat completely. In
some cases the cotyledons were found to be more or less swollen with
stored food-material. In the maize and wheat, however, the embryo forms
only a comparatively small proportion of the seed, the bulk of which
consists of stored food called endosperm. This is a difference of some
importance. Still more important, however, is the fact that the two
cotyledons, which were so conspicuous a feature of the other seeds,
cannot apparently be seen at all in these seeds. Are there then no
cotyledons in the seeds of the maize and wheat? If there are, how and
when do they appear, and what is their number?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<h4>4. THE EARLY STAGES OF GROWTH OF<br /> MAIZE AND WHEAT.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The roots.</b>—Watch for the appearance of the roots. Is there,
as in the seedlings previously studied, one principal root, or are
there soon several, all apparently of equal or nearly equal importance?
Do the roots grow straight down as before, or do they spread
horizontally?</p>

<p>2. <b>The stem and the cotyledon.</b>—Notice that a rod, somewhat
thicker than a root, grows out near the origin of the roots, and
curves upwards towards the light. When this is about an inch long on a
maize seedling, slit it open carefully, and observe that it consists
of a pale outer sheath and a green core. The sheath is the single
<i>cotyledon</i>; the green core is the young <i>stem</i> enclosed in a young
<i>foliage leaf</i>. Cut open the grain and notice how the endosperm has
shrivelled. As the seedlings become larger watch the young stem growing
out at the end of its sheathing cotyledon. What is the length of the
cotyledon when the stem first appears (<i>a</i>) in the maize, (<i>b</i>)
in the wheat?</p>

<p>3. <b>The foliage leaves.</b>—As soon as a foliage leaf unfolds make
a drawing of its shape. Contrast it with the young foliage leaves of
the other seedlings. Hold up the leaves to the light and compare the
arrangement of their veins.</p>

<p><b>How maize and wheat seeds grow.</b>—When the maize and wheat fruits
have been kept in damp sawdust for a few days, the seeds—one in each
fruit—begin to germinate. As a rule the wheat plants have grown to a
height of some inches before the roots and stems of the maize plant
have emerged from the seeds.</p>

<p><b>The roots.</b>—As might be expected, the first signs of life make
their appearance at the white scar which indicates the position of the
embryo or young plant. Instead of one main root growing out, several
little roots make their appearance almost at the same time. They do not
grow as directly downwards as the radicle of a pea or bean (<a href="#FIG_5-6">Fig. 6</a>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
but tend to spread in a horizontal direction (<a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>). It is clear that in
this way the roots are more independent of each other than if they grew
directly downward side by side.</p>

<p><b>The cotyledon and the stem.</b>—Growing out from the seed close to
the roots is another rod (<a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>, <i>C</i>), rather thicker than the roots,
which at once curves upwards to the light. It is pale green in colour.
This is the <b>cotyledon</b> or first leaf. When it is carefully slit
open, it is found to be a hollow sheath, enclosing a bright green
core. In the seedlings which are left undisturbed, the core at last
breaks through the tip of the cotyledon. It consists of the young
<b>stem</b> and its surrounding foliage leaves. As the growth of the
plant continues, these sheathing leaves unfold themselves into the long
narrow blades characteristic of grass leaves (<a href="#FIG_98">Fig. 98</a>).
The bottom of each leaf is tubular and forms a sheath round the stem.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_17" id="FIG_17"></a>

            <i>r</i>, roots. (×&nbsp;3.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>The endosperm.</b>—The endosperm, which at first made up more than
half the seed, gradually shrivels up as the little plant continues
its growth. The food material which it contains is absorbed by
the scutellum and is passed on to afford the plant the necessary
nourishment for those early stages when it is too young to feed itself.
By the time the first few foliage leaves are well developed, all that
remains of the grain is an empty husk.</p>

<p><b>Comparisons and contrasts.</b>—The examination of these seeds and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
seedlings will enable the student to see that differences, which at
the first glance appear great, are often of only minor importance;
while apparently small variations may prove, on closer inspection,
to be caused by deeply-seated differences of structure and habits of
life. He should always set himself the questions, “In what ways do such
and such objects resemble each other; and in what ways do they differ
from each other? Which of the differences and resemblances are of most
importance?” He should also notice that a mere difference of size is
often of very small consequence.</p>

<p>Above all, the student should get into the habit of asking the
<b>reasons</b> for the differences and resemblances which he notices
in his nature-study. To learn what these reasons are he must observe
closely, think carefully, and then make experiments to test the
accuracy of his conclusions. “Be sure you are right; then look
again”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
should be his motto.</p>

<p>It is at once plain that the seedlings fall into two classes, according
to the number of cotyledons or seed-leaves which they possess. The
wheat and maize have only one such seed-leaf, while the mustard,
bean, pea, sycamore, and vegetable marrow have two each. We shall
see later on that one-seed-leaved plants differ from those with two
seed-leaves not only in the number of their cotyledons, but also
in the characters of their leaves and flowers and in their method
of growth. These differences are so constant and so important that
botanists have agreed to call all plants of the first class (such as
maize and wheat) <b>Monocotyledons</b>, and plants of the second class
<b>Dicotyledons</b>.</p>

<p>One of these differences is that the main roots of dicotyledons
are formed directly by the growth of their radicles; while in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
monocotyledons there is, after a short time, no such main root to be
found, but several roots of almost equal size spring from the base of
the stem and spread outwards in all directions (<a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>).</p>

<p>Both maize and wheat seeds contain—<i>outside</i> the embryo—a large
store of food called endosperm (Figs. <a href="#FIG_14-15"> 15</a>
and <a href="#FIG_16"> 16</a>), which is not seen in any of the
dicotyledonous seeds described in this chapter. This is not a very
important difference, for, if we examined a very large number of
dicotyledon seeds, we should find that most of them possessed
endosperm. On the other hand, many monocotyledonous seeds are destitute
of endosperm. Only after observing a very large number of facts is it
safe to make general statements.</p>

<p>Confining our attention to dicotyledons, we are impressed by the great
variation in size of the cotyledons. Those of the bean and pea are
swollen with food material and form a large proportion of the bulk of
the seed. As a consequence, the seedling has enough food to enable it
to grow into quite a sturdy little plant before it needs any foliage
leaves. The cotyledons of the mustard and sycamore, however, are thin,
and they unfold almost immediately into green leaves, and set to work
to help to maintain the plant until the first foliage leaves can be
formed. The cotyledons of the lupine (<a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>) and vegetable
marrow (<a href="#FIG_10-11">Fig. 10</a>) serve a double purpose. They not only contain a store of food
ready to hand, but they also set to work early to make new food, until
the new leaves are sufficiently advanced to take up their duties. It
should be remembered that cotyledons are makeshift leaves.</p>

</div>
<h4>5. THE FOOD WHICH A GREEN PLANT<br /> OBTAINS FROM THE SOIL.</h4>

<p>1. <b>A plant cannot grow permanently in damp sawdust or clean
sand.</b>—Notice that the seedlings which were grown in damp sawdust
presently wither and die, while those which were grown in soil
flourish, and, with proper care, come to maturity. Obtain some clean
sand, and, to be sure that there is nothing in it which water can
dissolve, wash the sand in several changes of clean water. Germinate
some seeds in the sand, keeping it damp. The resulting plants in this
case also wither and die. Evidently soil contains some plant-food which
the plant cannot obtain from sawdust or clean sand. What is this food?</p>

</div>

<p>2. <b>The amount of water and mineral matter in plants.</b>—Take a
healthy plant, say a bean plant, and weigh it. Then dry it thoroughly
in the oven and weigh it again. It will be found very much lighter; the
difference in weight represents the water which has been driven off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Burn the dried plant. When the flame goes out notice the black charcoal
which is obtained. Continue the heating and observe that at last
nothing is left but a little grey ash. This experiment can be performed
over an ordinary fire by using an old shovel or a tile, but if you can
use a porcelain crucible (without lid) and a Bunsen burner (<a href="#FIG_18">Fig. 18</a>)
you will get better results. If a chemical balance is available, weigh
the ash and compare it with the weight of ash obtained from an ordinary
bean seed, such as that which gave rise to the plant you have used.</p>

<p>The ash from the plant is much greater than that got from the seed.
This extra ash must have been taken from the soil during the plant’s
growth.</p>

<p>3. <b>A nutritive solution.</b>—Make, or ask a dispensing chemist to
make, the following solution:</p>

<p>Water, with this solution, a plant growing in wet sand, and when it is
well grown, dry and burn it. As much ash is obtained as from a plant of
the same size grown in soil. Notice the difference between such a plant

<p>4. <b>Water culture.</b>—Fix two similar young plants in corks as
shown in <a href="#FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>, and put the corks into two bottles,
the first of which contains pure water and the second the nutritive solution,
and let the roots of the seedlings dip into the liquids. Cover the outsides
of the bottles with rolls of paper to keep out the light. Notice that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the plant living in the nutritive solution thrives, while the other
presently withers. Dry and burn the former, and observe that it yields
more ash than does a seed such as that from which it sprang.</p>

<p>5. <b>Plants obtain their mineral food from the soil by their
roots.</b>—As the roots are the only parts of the plant which are
in contact with the nutritive solution, or which (under ordinary
conditions) are in the soil, the mineral matter must be taken in by
the roots.</p>

<p>6. <b>The root-hairs.</b>—Take up a seedling which has been growing
in damp sand, and observe the small particles of sand adhering to the
root-hairs (<a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>). The hairs of a plant’s root and rootlets apply
themselves very closely to particles of soil (<a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>),
and the mineral food (dissolved in water) passes into the hairs and so gets
into the root and thence to the other parts of the plant.</p>

<p>7. <b>Roots as storehouses of food.</b>—Examine, before the plants
flower, the roots of a turnip, a carrot, and a radish, and notice
how greatly they are swollen. You know that these roots are valued
as foods; of what use do you think the stored food is <i>to the plants
themselves</i>?</p>

<p><b>The food of a young seedling.</b>—When such a seed as that of a
bean is germinated in damp sawdust or wet clean sand, and kept in a
warm and light place, it puts out a radicle, which grows downwards and
becomes the main root, and a stem which grows upwards and bears green
leaves. After a time the main root branches, giving off side roots,
which spread in all directions through the sawdust or sand. The main
root and the rootlets bear very fine fluffy hairs for a short length,
which is situated just behind their points (<a href="#FIG_10-11">Fig. 11</a>), and these root
hairs come into very close contact with particles of damp sawdust or
sand (<a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>), the moisture passing into them and thus reaching the
main root, from which it is distributed to the various parts of the
plant. The stem likewise flourishes, growing in length and thickness,
and putting out new leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
All this time the young bean plant is living on the food material
stored up in its cotyledons (<a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>); and if the sand or
sawdust is kept moist, with even pure water, this seed food is at first quite
sufficient. When at last the seed food is all used up, however, and all
that remains of the cotyledons is a shrivelled skin, the plant begins
to droop and wither from lack of food.</p>

<p><b>Plants obtain food from the soil.</b>—Contrast this with the
condition of a seedling which has been grown in soil. It still
flourishes, even when the seed food is used up, for it is drawing up
food from the soil—food which could not be obtained from the damp
sawdust or clean sand.</p>

<p>That the plant really has taken up some solid matter from the soil can
be proved by a few simple experiments. A plant which has been growing
in soil for some time after its seed food is used up is dried and
burnt, and the ashes are weighed. The weight of ash or mineral matter
thus obtained is found to be considerably greater than that of the ash
obtained from an ungerminated seed, or from a seedling grown in damp
sawdust or sand which has only been supplied with pure water.</p>

<p><b>The mineral food of plants.</b>—The composition of the ash obtained
from various plants has been carefully determined by chemists, and in
this manner they have been able to find out what substances must be
present in soil in order that the plant may obtain all the mineral
food it requires. A mixture of potassium nitrate (nitre), sodium
chloride (common salt), calcium sulphate (plaster of Paris), magnesium
sulphate (Epsom salts), calcium phosphate, and chloride (or sulphate)
of iron—dissolved in water in the proportions specified on <a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>—has
been found to supply the necessary elements of the mineral food in a
form which the plant can readily use. That such a mixture is capable of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
supporting the plant, while water alone is incapable of doing so, may
be seen by growing a plant—in the manner shown in <a href="#FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>—in this
solution. If, in addition, the plant is supplied with light and fresh
air, it will grow in a perfectly healthy and normal manner. If any of
the constituents (except the common salt) are omitted, the plant will
suffer. On the other hand, a plant which is growing in pure water will
presently die, from the lack of the necessary mineral food.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The work of the roots.</b>—These experiments show that water—of
which a large proportion of a plant consists—and the mineral
constituents of its food (dissolved in the soil-water) are taken up
from the soil by the roots. In ordinary soil the rootlets spread out
on all sides, dividing and subdividing, seeking for this very weak
solution of mineral salts. Even when soil appears practically dry, a
very thin film of moisture covers each little particle of earth, and
the root hairs become closely applied to these little particles (<a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>), so that the water passes through their walls and gradually makes
its way to the main root, the stem, and the leaves.</p>

</div>

<p>Roots sometimes perform other duties in addition to those of fixing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
plant in the soil and providing it with water and mineral food. It is
usual, for example, for <b>biennial plants</b>—which produce flowers
and seeds in their second year, and then die—to take in much more
food during their first season than they require at the time, and to
store up the surplus in readiness for the great effort of the second
year. These reserve materials are often stored in the roots, which then
become swollen and fleshy, like those of the turnip, radish, and carrot.</p>

<h4>6. THE FOOD WHICH A GREEN PLANT<br /> OBTAINS FROM THE AIR.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Plants contain much carbon.</b>—Char a stick, and notice the
black charcoal which is formed. Charcoal is an impure form of carbon.</p>

<p>2. <b>Carbon dioxide gas is formed when wood burns.</b>—Fasten a
shaving or a splinter of wood on a piece of wire, light it, and lower
it into a clean glass jar. When the wood has burned for a few seconds
take it out, and pour a little clear lime-water into the jar. The
lime-water turns milky. Similarly, pour a little lime-water into a jar
in which nothing has been burning, and notice that it remains clear.
There is evidently a difference in the nature of the air of the two
jars. The difference is caused by the burning of the wood, during
which some of the carbon unites with the oxygen of the air in the jar,
forming an invisible gas, called <i>carbon dioxide</i>. Carbon dioxide can
always be detected by the milkiness it causes in clear lime-water.</p>

<p>3. <b>Carbon dioxide present in ordinary air.</b>—Pour some clear
lime-water into a blue saucer and let it stand exposed to the air for
half an hour, then examine it. A white scum has formed on the surface
of the lime-water. Stir with a glass rod; the solution becomes milky.
The scum and the milkiness are produced by the union of the lime with
carbon dioxide from the air. Carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide) is
therefore present in the air.</p>

<p>4. <b>No carbon in the food solution.</b>—Examine again the list of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
elements (<a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>), which compose the mineral salts which have
been found to replace satisfactorily the food which a plant obtains from the soil.
<i>There is no carbon in it.</i> A plant evidently does not depend on the
soil for the carbonaceous part of its food. From what other source can
a plant obtain its carbon? Carbon has just been proved to be present in
the air. Does the plant obtain its carbon from the air?</p>

<p>5. <b>Green leaves contain starch after exposure to sunlight.</b>—Take
a green leaf from a plant which has been exposed to the sunlight,
boil the leaf in water for a minute or two to kill it. Then put it in
methylated spirit until the leaf-green is dissolved out. When the leaf
is bleached rinse it in water, then put it into a dilute solution of
iodine (<a href="#Page_2">p. 2</a>) and notice that it becomes blue or purplish brown.
The formation of this colour proves the presence of <i>starch</i> in the leaf.</p>

<p>6. <b>Starch contains carbon.</b>—Char a piece of laundry starch and
observe the charcoal formed.</p>

<p>7. <b>Green leaves do not contain starch after being left in the dark
for 24 hours.</b>—Keep a leafy plant in the dark for 24 hours and then
test a leaf as in the previous experiment. No starch can be detected.
Put the plant in the sunlight for an hour or two and test another leaf.
It contains starch. Plainly, starch is only formed in leaves if they
are exposed to light, and any starch previously present disappears when
the plant is kept in the dark.</p>

<p>8. <b>A green plant kept in air from which the carbon dioxide has been
removed will not form starch in its leaves.</b>—Obtain a large glass
bottle, such as those used by confectioners, and fit it with a cork
or india-rubber stopper through which passes a glass tube bent<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
as in <a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a>. Care should be taken to make all the joints tight, and it
may be necessary to soak the cork in melted paraffin to ensure this.
Pack the bend of the tube loosely with pieces of soda lime, and in
the bottle place a small jar containing lumps or a strong solution of
caustic soda. When the apparatus is ready, place in the bottle a small
plant or a leafy twig in water (fuchsia answers very well), which has
been kept in the dark for 24 hours. The caustic soda in the jar very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
soon absorbs all the carbon dioxide which is present, and the soda lime
in the bend of the tube prevents any carbon dioxide from getting into
the bottle from the outside air. Place the jar in bright sunlight for a
few hours and then test a leaf for starch. None can be detected. It is
plain that one of the carbonaceous food stuffs—starch—is not formed
in the leaves of plants unless the plant is grown (in the light) in air
containing carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>9. <b>Seedlings are at first independent of light.</b>—Germinate pea
or bean seeds in wet sand or sawdust in the dark. Notice that for some
time the seedlings grow almost as well as when in the light. Soon,
however, the stem becomes long, weak and straggling, and the leaves are
pale in colour, even if the plant is supplied with mineral food.</p>

<p>10. <b>The formation of sugar in a germinating pea-seed.</b>—Take up
a pea-seedling when the stem is one or two inches long, and chew the
partly shrunken cotyledons. Notice the slightly sweet taste. Contrast
this with the taste of an ungerminated seed.</p>

<p><b>A plant contains much carbon.</b>—When a piece of wood or other
part of a plant is strongly heated it first blackens or chars, showing
the presence of a large proportion of charcoal or impure carbon. On
continued heating, this carbon “burns away.” In the process of burning
it unites with some of the oxygen of the air, and forms a colourless,
invisible gas known as <b>carbon dioxide</b>. Though this substance
cannot be seen, its presence can be easily detected by means of clear
lime-water, which, when exposed to the gas, absorbs it and becomes
milky owing to the formation of a white precipitate of chalk. If, for
example, a splinter of wood is burnt in a glass jar, and a little clear
lime-water is immediately afterwards poured into the jar and shaken up,
a milkiness at once proclaims the presence of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><b>The air contains carbon.</b>—If lime-water is poured into a blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
saucer and left exposed to the air for half an hour, a white scum
of chalk is seen to have formed on its surface, showing that carbon
dioxide is present in the atmosphere. It is important that the student
should realise this presence of carbon—as invisible carbon dioxide
gas—in the air. Although the proportion is very small, amounting to
only 3 parts of carbon dioxide in 10,000 parts of fresh country air, it
is of incalculable importance to plants, and indirectly to ourselves
and all other animals.</p>

<p><b>A green plant obtains its carbon from the air.</b>—Since the
parts of a plant contain much carbon, and the food which a plant
obtains from the soil need not contain any carbon; while the air, on
the other hand, does contain carbon, it seems likely that a plant
obtains its carbonaceous food from the air. This surmise is confirmed
by experiments. One of the most easily recognisable of plant products
containing carbon is <b>starch</b>, for it yields a very characteristic
blue, or purplish-brown, colour when treated with iodine solution. By
means of this test starch can easily be proved to be present in the
green leaves of a plant which has been exposed to the air and sunlight.
The leaf is first killed by being boiled in water for a minute or two,
and then its green colouring matter is dissolved out by immersion in
alcohol (methylated spirit). The bleached leaf is rinsed in water and
then put in iodine solution, and the blue or purplish-brown colour
which is formed shows the presence of starch. There is a marked
difference when a leaf, which has been kept in the dark for twenty-four
hours, is similarly tested. In this case no starch can be detected.</p>

<p>One compound of carbon—<i>i.e.</i> starch—may thus be recognised easily;
and if we found that a leaf made no starch when supplied only with air
from which the carbon dioxide had been removed, this fact would be
strong evidence in favour of the conclusion that a green plant obtains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
its carbon from the carbon dioxide of the air. To test this, a large
bottle is fitted, by means of a tightly fitting cork or stopper, with a
tube containing lumps of soda lime, a substance which eagerly absorbs
carbon dioxide from air. A small jar of caustic soda is placed inside
the bottle (<a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a>). A green plant or a leafy twig, which has been
kept for twenty-four hours in the dark to free it from starch, is
then put in the bottle, and the whole exposed to sunlight for a few
hours. At the end of this time it is found, on testing the leaves,
that no starch has been formed. By this, and other experiments,
botanists have proved that <i>green plants obtain all their carbon from
the carbon dioxide of the air, and that sunlight is indispensable for
the process</i>. We shall examine this question more fully when we study
leaves (<a href="#Page_37">Chapter III.</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><b>The carbonaceous food of a young seedling.</b>—Just as a bean or
pea seedling is for a time independent of an outside supply of mineral
food—its roots needing only to be supplied with water—so there is
enough carbonaceous food also stored up in the seed to satisfy for some
time the needs of the growing plant—the stored starch being gradually
changed into sugar and absorbed. For this reason a young seedling will
live healthily in the dark. When, however, the seed food is exhausted,
or nearly so, the plant draws upon the store of carbon, which is
present as carbon dioxide in the air, for a renewal of the starch and
allied substances which are necessary to it. As it cannot make use of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
this atmospheric carbon in the dark, it must henceforth be supplied
with sunlight or it will not thrive. Plants kept in the dark after
their seed-food is exhausted are pale in colour and unhealthy. Their
stems grow long and straggling (<a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>), but
are usually too weak to stand upright.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class="h_subtitle">THE FORMS AND DUTIES OF LEAVES.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>7. THE FORMS OF LEAVES.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The shapes.</b>—Make a collection of the leaves of a large
number of different plants, for example, elm, beech, lime, oak, birch,
ash, blackberry, pine, yew, horse chestnut, rose, holly, woodsorrel,
grass. Lay each in turn flat in your notebook and trace the shape of
the leaf blade by passing the point of your pencil round the edge.
Measure the length and greatest width; write down these dimensions. Is
the greatest width at, above, or below, the middle of the leaf blade?</p>

<p>Most of the leaves are flattened green plates. Those of the pine and
yew are long and needle-shaped. Do you know any other leaves like these?</p>

<p>2. <b>The veins.</b>—What enables the leaf to keep stretched out? Turn
it over and notice the “veins” on the lower side. Do they act like the
ribs of an umbrella? Fill in the positions of the main veins in your
drawings. Are the veins parallel to each other in any of your leaves?
Write a list of as many leaves as you can find which have parallel
veins.</p>

<p>3. <b>Skeleton leaves.</b>—Put some leaves in a saucer with a little
<i>soft</i> water, and allow them to rot. Clean away the soft stuff from
time to time by <i>gently</i> brushing the leaves with an old tooth-brush.
Notice the “skeleton” which remains. Skeleton leaves may be made much
more quickly by soaking the leaves for some time in a <i>weak</i> solution
of bleaching powder. Wash them well before drying.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <b>The colour.</b>—Is the green deeper on the upper or the lower
surface of a leaf? Which surface usually receives more light?</p>

<p>5. <b>The apex.</b>—In how many of your leaves is the apex (<i>a</i>)
pointed, (<i>b</i>) blunt, (<i>c</i>) rounded?</p>

<p>6. <b>The margin.</b>—Examine the edge or margin of each leaf. In how
many is it (<i>a</i>) quite plain, (<i>b</i>) hairy, (<i>c</i>) wavy, (<i>d</i>) saw-edged,
(<i>e</i>) doubly saw-edged, (<i>f</i>) spiny? Do you find spines on holly leaves
which are so high on the tree as to be out of the reach of cattle? What
is the use of the spines?</p>

<p>7. <b>Blackberry leaves.</b>—Gather several leaves from a blackberry
bush. Notice that in addition to the “saw cuts,” the margins of
some are cut into slightly, while others are divided quite to the
midrib, the leaf being thus cut into two or more <i>leaflets</i>. Select
specimens which form a gradual series between the “simple” leaf and the
“compound” leaf (consisting of three or five leaflets) and draw them.</p>

<p>8. <b>The horse chestnut leaf.</b>—Draw the compound leaf of the
horse chestnut, and draw an even curved line joining the points of the
leaflets. You can imagine that the compound leaf may have been formed
by a leaf of this shape being cut into until it was divided into seven
complete leaflets.</p>

<p>9. <b>The rose leaf.</b>—Draw an imaginary simple leaf such as may
have been the original form from which the compound leaf of the rose
was derived. Notice the difference in the arrangement of the main veins
of the leaves of the horse chestnut and the rose. Does this account for
the leaflets coming off at the sides of the midrib in the rose leaf,
and springing from one point, like fingers from the palm of the hand,
in the case of the horse chestnut?</p>

<p>10. <b>Sycamore and ivy leaves.</b>—If the large indentations in these
leaves were continued to the midrib, would the compound leaves thus
formed be of the type of the rose leaf or of that of the horse chestnut
leaf?</p>

<p>11. <b>The leaf-stalk.</b>—What attaches the leaf-blade to the stem or
branch of the plant? Can you see signs of the main veins joining the
top of the leaf-stalk? Do you know any plant with the blades of the
leaves fixed <i>directly</i> on the stem, <i>i.e.</i> without any leaf-stalks?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>12. <b>Stipules.</b>—Examine the rose leaf again and notice the two
leaf-like outgrowths at the bottom of the stalk. These are called
<i>stipules</i>. Make a list of as many leaves as you can find which have
stipules. How many leaves can you find with a <i>sheath</i> at the bottom of
the stalk?</p>

<p>13. <b>The leaf of the sweet pea.</b>—Notice the large stipules of
this compound leaf (<a href="#FIG_27-28">Fig. 28</a>). What are the tendrils? Do
you think they may be mainly the larger veins of the upper leaflets? Is the
leaf of the type of the rose or of the horse chestnut leaf?</p>

<p>14. <b>Other compound leaves.</b>—Compare and contrast ash, lupine,
woodsorrel, strawberry, and other compound leaves with those of the
rose and horse chestnut.</p>

<p><b>A leaf.</b>—The leaves of different plants vary much in size and
shape, but in general a leaf is a thin, broad, and more or less oval
<b>blade</b> of green colour, attached by a leaf <b>stalk</b> to the
stem or branch. In some cases, however, the leaf stalk is absent and
the blade is attached directly to the stem or branch.</p>

<p><b>The veins.</b>—The leaf is kept taut by a number of branching ribs,
somewhat as the silk of an opened umbrella is stretched tightly by the
ribs. The ribs or “veins” of the leaf run beneath the skin, but are
generally nearer the lower surface than the upper, and are easily seen
when the leaf is turned over. If a leaf is allowed to rot in a little
soft water, the skin and the soft green stuff of the interior decay and
leave these veins as a white “skeleton” (<a href="#FIG_23-24">Fig. 23</a>).
The process may be assisted by <i>gently</i> brushing the leaf from time to
time. A skeleton leaf may be obtained still more quickly by putting
the leaf in a <i>weak</i> solution of bleaching powder until the skin and
interior are soft enough to be brushed away. Care should be taken to
use a weak solution, or the veins also will be rotted. The skeleton
should be well washed in water before drying.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the veins in a leaf varies widely, but it falls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
broadly into two classes, according as the main veins run parallel or
nearly parallel to each other (<a href="#FIG_23-24">Fig. 24</a>), or form a less regular network
(<a href="#FIG_23-24">Fig. 23</a>). The <b>venation</b> of a leaf is curiously associated
with the number of cotyledons possessed by the seedling; for nearly
all dicotyledons (<a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>) have net-veined leaves, while the
leaves of monocotyledons are almost invariably parallel-veined. Careful drawings
of several typical leaves should be made, and the principal veins
indicated on them.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The shapes of leaves.</b>—Although the blade of a leaf is
most commonly flattened, and roughly oval in outline, there are
several exceptions. The leaves of pine, spruce, larch, and yew are
needle-shaped; those of grasses (Figs. 102-110) are very long in
proportion to their width; while the leaves of many moorland plants are
rolled up into hollow cylinders. There is some reason—could we find
it—for every such variation, and the significance of some of these
shapes will be referred to later (<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>). When the <i>dimensions</i>
of leaves are carefully measured, the proportion of the length to the width
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
will be found to vary much in the leaves of different
plants, but will be found to be pretty constant for the same
sort of plant. This holds good, too, for the position of the
greatest width (<i>e.g.</i> at, above, or below, the middle of the
blade), the form of the <i>apex</i> of the blade (blunt, pointed,
spiny, or rounded), the nature of the <i>margin</i> (smooth and
“entire,” hairy, saw-edged, doubly saw-edged, lobed, etc.),
and the extent and positions of the larger <i>indentations</i>. Thus,
while any particular elm leaf (<a href="#FIG_124">Fig. 124</a>) is probably
slightly different from every other elm leaf in the world, it resembles
every other elm leaf more than it does any leaf from any other
plant than an elm. No leaf of this shape ever grows on an
oak tree or a sycamore. Thus, in spite of minor variations
there is a wonderful <b>conformity to type</b>, and the student will
find that by carefully examining the shape, venation, margin,
apex, etc., of all his leaves, and above all by <i>drawing</i> them,
he will soon be able to recognise them at sight. It is by
doing this and noticing in each case the methods of folding
and arrangement of young leaves in the bud that it may be
possible in the future to explain some variations which are at
present not understood. It has already been seen that the
peculiar forms of the leaves known as <i>cotyledons</i> are associated
to some extent with the shape and size of the seeds containing
them, and with the amount, if any, of the food stored in them.</p>

<p><b>Simple and compound leaves.</b>—Blackberry leaves (<a href="#FIG_76">Fig. 76</a>)
well repay close examination. Some of the leaves on the bush will be found
to be simple—having one blade only on the leaf stalk. Here and there,
however, a leaf may be discovered which is so deeply cut into along one
side, that it is almost completely divided into two leaflets; and other
leaves will easily be found which consist of three or five leaflets,
much resembling the leaves of the rose (<a href="#FIG_25-26">Fig. 25</a>), a near relative of
the blackberry. Here, then, we have a plant which produces simple or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
compound leaves according to its needs. It seems as if the blackberry
were still trying, as an experiment, a device which the rose tree has
found so advantageous as to have adopted for good. Some other plants,
the ash, for example, have compound leaves broadly similar to the rose
leaf—the leaflets springing in pairs from the sides of the midrib.</p>

</div>

<p>The compound leaf of the horse chestnut (<a href="#FIG_25-26">Fig. 26</a>) is of a different
type, for the seven leaflets all arise from one point; and the leaves
of the lupine (<a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>) are arranged on the same plan. When the venation
is examined, the reason for this becomes plain. In these cases the
main veins all diverge from the top of the leaf stalk; whereas in the
rose and ash the midrib gives rise to side ribs in pairs. The leaflets
are naturally arranged so that one of the larger veins shall support
each. The next question arising is, “What causes the differences in
the methods of branching of the midrib?” At present this is a mystery.
Compound leaves consisting of <i>three</i> leaflets are found in woodsorrel,
strawberry (<a href="#FIG_50">Fig. 50</a>), clover, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Intermediate leaves.</b>—The ivy (<a href="#FIG_27-28">Fig. 27</a>)
and sycamore (<a href="#FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>) have leaves which
seem intermediate between truly simple and truly compound leaves.
From the arrangement of the veins it is seen that they approach the
horse chestnut type more than that of the rose. On the other hand,
if the deep indentations of the oak leaf (<a href="#FIG_113">Fig. 113</a>) were carried to
the midrib, the simple leaf would be divided into leaflets arranged,
somewhat like those of the rose or ash leaf, along the sides of the midrib.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Stipules.</b>—At the bases of many leaf stalks, close to the stem,
are leaf-like outgrowths called <b>stipules</b>. They are well seen in
the rose (<a href="#FIG_25-26">Fig. 25</a>) and pea (<a href="#FIG_27-28">Fig. 28</a>).
Some leaves have a <b>sheath</b> at the bottom of the stalk, partially enclosing the stem.</p>

<p><b>Tendrils.</b>—The pea also affords an interesting case of leaflets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
being modified to do special work. Here the upper leaflets seem to
have remained undeveloped except for their main veins, and these have
acquired a remarkable power of twining round suitable objects and so
supporting the stem. Many other plants have tendrils, but these are not
always modified leaflets.</p>

<h4>8. HOW LEAVES ARE ARRANGED ON THE STEM.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Opposite leaves.</b>—Examine a deadnettle plant (<a href="#FIG_92">Fig. 92</a>).
Do the leaves come off the stem haphazard? How many come off at each
level? Are both leaves on the same side of the stem, or opposite each
other? Are the two leaves at the next level above just over these, or
do the directions cross? Do the leaves get as much light or more than
they would if each pair were just over the pair next below? How many
other plants do you know which have leaves arranged in this manner?
Examine leafy twigs of sycamore, horse chestnut (<a href="#FIG_39-40">Fig. 40</a>),
and ash. Are the stalks of the lower leaves of these twigs of the same length
as those of the upper ones? Is it any advantage for the lower leaves to
have longer leaf stalks?</p>

<p>2. <b>Box leaves.</b>—What is the arrangement in the box? Examine
particularly the young leaves near the end of the twig. Are the lower
ones twisted? Can you suggest a reason for this twisting? Can you find
any twigs in which no twisting has taken place? Are these untwisted
twigs so placed that they are equally exposed to the light on all sides?</p>

<p>3. <b>Alternate leaves.</b>—Examine the arrangement of the leaves on
a wallflower stem. They come off <i>alternately</i>, each springing from a
rib on the stem. How many ribs are there? Look at the bottom of the
stem, where the leaves have fallen off, and notice that each has left
a scar. Mark one of the scars with your pencil and then count how many
scars you pass before coming to another on the same rib. How many
times do you wind round the stem in doing this? You pass five leaves
and wind spirally round the stem twice. This is always the case in the
wallflower.</p>

<p>Examine leafy twigs of oak and pear trees. Here, too, the leaves are
<i>alternate</i>, and every sixth leaf is above the first, and a line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
joining all the leaf-bases or scars between the first and sixth leaves
would wind spirally round the stem twice.</p>

<p>What is the arrangement in the elm and lime?</p>

<p>4. <b>Leaves which form a rosette.</b>—Examine plants of primrose
(<a href="#FIG_81">Fig. 81</a>) and daisy. The leaves in these cases spring from close to the
ground and form a rosette. Notice that the bottom of the leaf blade is
much narrower than the upper part. Is any saving of material obtained
by this arrangement?</p>

<p>5. <b>The position of branches and buds.</b>—Look in the upper angle
between a leaf and the stem in all your specimens. This angle is called
the <i>axil</i> of the leaf. Can you see a <i>bud</i> in the axil of the leaf?
Can you find that a bud or a side branch ever arises in any other
position? (The former positions of fallen leaves are marked by scars.)</p>

<p>To the beginner in nature-study leaves seem in the majority of cases to
be arranged on the stem of a plant in a haphazard and confusing manner,
and it is only after very careful observation that a definite order and
regularity is seen to be always maintained.</p>

<p><b>Nodes and internodes.</b>—The level at which a leaf springs from
the stem is called a <b>node</b> (Lat. <i>nodus</i>, a knot), and the length
between two consecutive nodes is called an <b>internode</b> (Lat.
<i>inter</i>, between).</p>

<p><b>Opposite leaves.</b>—It is best to begin the study of
leaf-arrangement by examining some such plant as the <b>deadnettle</b>
(<a href="#FIG_92">Fig. 92</a>). The leaves come off in pairs: two at
the same level, set opposite to each other. The next pair above or
below springs from the stem in a direction at <i>right angles</i> to the
first—a device which allows the leaves to get a more equal share of
light than if each pair were placed directly over the next below.</p>

<p>A similar arrangement is adopted by various other plants,
including the <b>horse chestnut</b> (<a href="#FIG_39-40">Fig. 40</a>),
<b>sycamore</b> (<a href="#FIG_34">Fig. 34</a>), <b>box</b>,
<b>privet</b>, etc., but in some instances it is disguised. <b>Box</b>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
twigs afford an interesting example of this. Those twigs which are
equally, or almost equally, illuminated on all sides, have their leaves
arranged in pairs at right angles to each other like those of the
deadnettle. Some twigs, however, receive the light from one direction
only, and in these cases the leaves turn themselves until they face the
light; so that at a casual glance the pairs of leaves seem to lie all
in the same plane. One only needs to examine the end of the twig, where
the leaves are just unfolding, to see that the arrangement is really
in pairs alternately at right angles. In the case of the <i>privet</i> the
efforts of the leaves to face the light often cause the stem itself to
be twisted between the leaf-levels.</p>

<p><b>The alternate, or spiral, arrangement.</b>—Perhaps the commonest
leaf-arrangement is one in which only one leaf is given off at any
particular node, the next leaf being a little further round the stem,
and so on. As a result, an ink line or a piece of thread joining the
leaf-bases would wind spirally round the stem. In the case of the
<b>wallflower</b>, <b>oak</b>, <b>pear</b>, and many others, such a
line would wind spirally <i>twice</i> round the stem before coming to a
leaf vertically above the first, and in so doing it would pass <i>five</i>
leaves. This may be shortly described as the ²/₅ arrangement. A less
common one is ⅜, where in winding spirally round the stem 3 times, 8
leaves would be passed.</p>

<p><b>Efforts of leaves to obtain light.</b>—It would be difficult to
imagine any order of insertion which would secure a more <i>equal</i>
distribution of light to each leaf than the spiral arrangement; but
here also cases of leaves twisting in order to face the light are not
uncommon. <b>Lime</b> leaves very often turn for this reason, so as
to lie in almost the same plane—adopting a device similar to that of
the box and privet described above. Further, the lime leaves arrange
themselves at such angles that there is very little overlapping. Elm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
twigs also often exhibit similar instances of a mutual accommodation of
leaves to each other’s light supply.</p>

<p>The lower leaves on a <b>horse chestnut</b> twig have longer stalks
than those nearer the end (<a href="#FIG_39-40">Fig. 40</a>). This enables the
leaves to stand well out to the light and escape the overshadowing of those above.</p>

<p><b>The positions of branches.</b>—A branch of the stem of a flowering
plant always arises as a bud in the upper angle between a leaf and
the stem. This position is called by botanists the <b>axil of the
leaf</b>, from the Latin word <i>axilla</i>, the arm-pit. Clearly, then,
the arrangement of the branches is primarily dependent upon that of
the leaves, and we shall, for example, never find “opposite” branches
on a tree which bears its leaves on the “alternate” system. It is
easy to notice, however, that not all the buds develop into branches.
In other words there are many buds which remain dormant, and the
final arrangement of the branches is often somewhat irregular on this
account. But wherever an ordinary bud or a branch occurs, we may be
perfectly sure that there was once a leaf immediately below, even if
the leaf-scar can no longer be seen.</p>

<p><b>Economy of leaf surface.</b>—All these things seem to indicate
that a good supply of light is of the greatest importance to leaves,
and this conclusion is supported by the fact that leaves are usually
either narrow or actually cut away in places where the light cannot
reach them. The leaves of the daisy and of the primrose (<a href="#FIG_81">Fig. 81</a>),
for example, all spring from nearly the same point, and form a rosette.
Evidently there would be a certain amount of overlapping at the
leaf-bases, unless the blades there were very narrow, as they are.
Again, the greatly-indented leaves of the ivy are often arranged
so that a point of one leaf fits over an indentation of another—a
beautiful example of plant economy.

<h4>9. THE WORK OF LEAVES.</h4>

<p>1. <b>In sunlight leaves make starch.</b>—Expts. 5, 7, and 8 (Sec. 6)
have already proved (<i>a</i>) that leaves of a plant growing in ordinary
air and exposed to the sunlight make starch; (<i>b</i>) that in the dark
this starch somehow disappears; (<i>c</i>) that in air destitute of carbon
dioxide leaves are unable to make starch even in sunlight.</p>

<p>2. <b>The parts of a leaf which are not exposed to light do not make
starch.</b>—Keep a plant, say of tropæolum—or, if not convenient, a
single leaf (<a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31</a>)—in the dark for 24 hours to free the
leaves from starch. Split a small cork and pin the halves on opposite sides of a
leaf, and then expose the plant to bright sunlight for an hour or two.
(If a single leaf is used let the end of the stalk dip into water.)
Take off the cork, kill the leaf with boiling water, dissolve out the
green colouring matter with methylated spirit, rinse, and test with
iodine solution. The part from which the light was excluded remains
bleached, and therefore contains no starch; while the rest of the leaf
becomes blue or purplish brown owing to the presence of starch.</p>

<p>3. <b>Parts of a leaf which are not green do not form starch in
sunlight.</b>—Take a variegated leaf from a plant (<i>e.g.</i> the
variegated geranium or maple) which has been in bright sunlight for
some hours. Apply the usual test for starch. The parts which were
originally green contain starch; the originally white parts remain
bleached.</p>

<p>4. <b>Leaves supplied with carbon dioxide, and exposed to sunlight,
give off oxygen gas.</b>—(<i>a</i>) Take a bunch of fresh watercress or any
green water-weed and put it in a beaker or glass jar. Cover the plant
with an inverted funnel which is shorter than the beaker. Now fill the
beaker with ordinary tap water or river water (<i>not</i> distilled water),
so that the end of the neck of the funnel is covered. Completely fill
a narrow test tube with water, close it with the thumb, and invert it
over the neck of the funnel. If this has been done carefully the test
tube will still be full of water. Expose the arrangement (<a href="#FIG_29-30">Fig. 29</a>)
to bright sunlight, and notice the bubbles of gas which are given off from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the plant and collect at the top of the tube. When a few inches of gas
have collected, raise the test tube, close it with the thumb whilst
still under water, and hold it mouth upwards. In the meantime, light a
splinter of wood with the other hand. When it is well burning, blow out
the light, remove the thumb from the test tube, and plunge the glowing
splinter into the gas. It bursts into flame again, showing that the gas
is <i>oxygen</i>.</p>

    </tbody>
   </table>
</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Repeat the experiment, (i) placing the apparatus in the dark,
(ii) without using any plant. No gas collects in the test tube.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) To show that the water used contains carbon dioxide in solution,
completely fill a gallon can or a large flask with similar water, and
attach a cork and a delivery tube which has also been filled with
water—dipping the end of the tube into a little clear lime-water
(<a href="#FIG_29-30">Fig. 30</a>). Put the same quantity of lime-water
into another vessel for comparison, and then heat the can. Gas is given
off, and as it bubbles through the lime-water the liquid is gradually
turned milky.</p>

<p>5. <b>Leaves wither in sunlight unless supplied with water.</b>—(<i>a</i>)
Cut off a leafy twig and leave it exposed to sunlight for an hour or
two; notice the change in the appearance of the leaves.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Put a similar twig in the dark for the same length of time; again
notice the leaves. Is the difference due to a difference in light or to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
one of heat? (<i>c</i>) To test this, keep, if possible, a similar twig in
the dark in a warm place. Do the leaves wither as much as in (<i>a</i>)?</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Smear with vaseline the <i>under</i> surface of some of the leaves of
such a twig and again expose to sunlight. Do the smeared leaves remain
fresh longer than the others?</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Cut off the end of a twig with a sharp knife whilst it is under
water, and leave it exposed to sunlight, dipping in water. The leaves
remain fresh. How do you explain these differences?</p>

<p>6. <b>In sunlight, leaves give off water.</b>—Take a piece of
cardboard about 4 in. square and make a small hole in the middle.
Pass the end of a leafy twig through the hole and make up with wax
any chinks between the twig and the card. Put the card on a tumbler
containing water, so that the end of the twig dips under water; and
invert on the card—covering the leafy end of the twig—a second
tumbler which is clean and dry. Put the apparatus in the sunshine and
notice the mistiness (or even visible drops of water) forming on the
inside of the upper tumbler. Where does this moisture come from?</p>

<p>7. <b>The skin of a leaf is perforated by little pores.</b>—Dip a
fresh laurel leaf into boiling water in a beaker or tumbler. Can you
see bubbles of air escaping from the leaf? Are they to be seen on both
surfaces of the leaf, or only on one? Which?</p>

<p>Examine both surfaces of box leaves with a strong lens, and try to see
the little dots (pores) on the lower surface.</p>

<p>The student who has performed the experiments described in this
section, and who has thought about the results obtained, cannot but
have gained some insight into the main duties of leaves. The meaning of
these results must now be discussed.</p>

<p><b>The formation of starch in leaves.</b>—When the green leaves
of a plant are exposed to sunlight in ordinary air—that is in air
containing a certain proportion of carbon dioxide—the leaf forms
starch in its interior, and the starch can be detected by applying the
iodine test (<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>). When part of a leaf is protected from the light,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
as by pinning the halves of a split cork on opposite sides of it (<a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31</a>),
no starch is formed in the shaded parts, but only in the regions
which are exposed to the light. Further, if a variegated leaf is
treated in the same way, starch can be detected only in those parts of
the leaf which were originally green; the parts which were white are
free from starch. It is plain that it is the green colouring matter
which puts the energy of the sunlight at the disposal of the leaf and
enables it to manufacture starch.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_31" id="FIG_31"></a>
    <img src="images/i_051.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="219" />

     iodine solution, after exposure to sunlight for an hour.<br />The part shielded
     from the light remains bleached; the rest of the leaf has turned blue.</p>
</div>

<p>At least three conditions are therefore necessary for the formation of
starch in leaves: (1) the green colouring matter; (2) sunlight; (3)
carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><b>Oxygen is liberated when leaves form starch.</b>—Carbon dioxide
gas, which has been seen to be indispensable for the manufacture of
starch in leaves, consists of carbon, or charcoal, chemically united
with the gas oxygen. The green-stuff of the interior of the leaf makes
the starch by causing this carbon to combine with water which has come
up from the roots, but it returns to the air the unnecessary oxygen.
Water plants, the leaves of which are not directly exposed to the air,
use carbon dioxide which the water has dissolved from the air. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
also give off the surplus oxygen, after fixing the carbon. This is the
explanation of the bubbles of gas which, in sunlight, are often seen
rising from the plants in an aquarium. By such an arrangement as is
described in Expt. 9, 4, this evolved gas can be collected, and proved
to be oxygen.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>—Experiment to<br />prove
         that green leaves,<br />exposed to sunlight,<br />give off water.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The use of water to the leaves.</b>—It is common knowledge that if
a twig is allowed to become dry its leaves hang limply and wither; but
if the twig is allowed to dip into water the leaves will keep fresh and
crisp for a considerable time. This necessity for supplying the twig
with water seems to indicate that leaves give off water, and that this
is so may be proved by a few simple experiments. Two tumblers may be
arranged as in <a href="#FIG_32">Fig. 32</a>: separated by a card through which
passes the end of a leafy twig. The end of the twig dips into water in the lower
tumbler. In order to prevent water vapour from passing from the lower
tumbler to the upper, the chinks between the twig and the card are
sealed with paraffin wax.</p>

<p>When this arrangement is placed in the sunlight, a dew soon collects
on the inside of the inverted upper tumbler. This water must have been
given off in the form of vapour from the leaves. That the loss of water
from leaves is due rather to the light than to the heat of the sunshine
may be shown by keeping leafy twigs in the dark. The leaves keep fresh
much longer than when placed in the light, even if they are kept in as
warm a place.</p>

<p><b>The pores of the leaf-surface.</b>—An ordinary leaf remains
fresh much longer if its lower surface is smeared with vaseline. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
explanation of this lies in the fact that the waterproof skin of a leaf
is perforated by a multitude of little pores, especially on the lower
surface. In most leaves, indeed, the pores are confined to the lower
surface. Smearing the surface with vaseline blocks up these pores and
thus prevents the escape of water vapour from the interior of the leaf.</p>

<p>These little mouths (known as <i>stomata</i>)<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
open in the light and close in the dark. During the daytime, therefore,
the air (containing its small proportion of carbon dioxide) has free
access to the interior of the leaf through the stomata, and, on the
other hand, any water which the leaf does not require can escape in the
form of vapour. A leaf requires water not only because all its mineral
food (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>) is brought to it dissolved in water, but also
because water as well as carbon dioxide is required for the manufacture of the
starch and other plant-foods.</p>

<p><b>How plant-food is distributed.</b>—The water which comes up from
the roots is distributed to the various parts of the leaf through the
<i>veins</i>. These are therefore not only supports, which stretch out
the soft leaf-stuff to the light and air, but they also form a very
complete network of <i>irrigating channels</i> or water pipes. Further, the
starch and other foods which a leaf makes are drained off into the
stem through other minute channels which are bound up with the water
pipes. The starch, for example, is changed into a kind of sugar which
dissolves in water and drains away. From the stem, the food solutions
are distributed to all the parts where growth is taking place.

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class="h_subtitle">BUDS. THE HISTORY OF A TWIG.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>10. THE STRUCTURE AND USES OF BUDS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>A typical bud.</b>—Split a cabbage, or a lettuce “heart,” down
the middle, and observe how the leaves are arranged round the conical
end of the stalk. The leaves which are fixed lowest on the stalk are
the largest, and they cover the outside of the bud. The leaves are
smaller and smaller as they are fixed nearer and nearer the end of the
stalk, until round the tip they are almost too small to be recognised
as leaves. A <i>bud</i> is the tip or “growing point” of a stem or branch,
together with the young leaves which crowd round it. Draw the section.</p>

<p>2. <b>A sycamore twig.</b>—Look in the axils (<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>) of the
leaves of a sycamore twig in summer or autumn, and notice the buds. Can you
see any buds on the lower parts of the twig—which bore leaves twelve
months or longer ago? Did these also arise in the axils of leaves? How
can you be sure they did? Tie a piece of string, or tape, round this
twig and look at it often, making a note of every change which you see
in it.</p>

<p>3. <b>The fall of the leaf.</b>—On what date did you first notice that
the leaves of the sycamore were falling? Did the first leaves fall from
the twigs at, or near, the ends of the branches, or lower down near the
trunk? Examine the scar left by the first leaf which falls from your
twig. What is its shape? What is the meaning of the dark dots on the
scar? Gently take off the leaf nearest to the scar. Does it come off
easily? Are there any dark dots on this scar? Can you see anything on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the end of the leaf stalk corresponding to the dots? Do you think the
dots are the ends of the food pipes referred to on <a href="#Page_53">p. 53</a>?</p>

<p>Make a drawing of a fallen leaf and write down on the drawing at the
proper place, the colour of that part of the leaf, or better still,
colour the drawing with water-colour paints. Collect good specimens of
the autumn leaves of as many other trees as possible, and make coloured
drawings of them.</p>

<p>On what date did you first notice that all the leaves were shed? Make
similar notes for other trees.</p>

<p>4. <b>The structure of a sycamore bud.</b>—In winter take off a
sycamore twig which has a big bud at the end, and examine it. The bud
is clothed with overlapping scales of a pale green colour. Make a
drawing of the bud, double the size, and then take off the scales one
by one and count them. Look with a lens at the upper end of one of the
largest scales. Can you see any trace of a rudimentary leaf blade? When
the last scale is removed there remains on the end of the twig a tiny
tuft of delicate green leaves surrounded by a little down. Count them,
and notice how each is folded up fanwise. In some buds you may find a
bunch of green flowers in the middle. These buds are larger than those
containing leaves only.</p>

<p>Cut a bud across with a sharp knife, and examine the cut surface with
a lens to see more clearly how the scales and young foliage leaves are
arranged. Draw what you see.</p>

<p>5. <b>How the bud bursts.</b>—In spring watch your twig very carefully
to be sure you do not miss any stage of the opening of the buds. Make
drawings every day or two of the end bud, when it has begun to unfold.
Notice how the scales fall off—those on the outside first—and how the
foliage leaves push open the upper scales and come out. Watch the way
in which each leaf opens its folds and spreads itself out flat.</p>

<p>The buds may be made to open earlier by <i>cutting</i> off a twig about two
or three feet long and keeping it in water in a warm room.</p>

<p>6. <b>Starch is stored up in the twigs.</b>—Cut off a twig and pour
a drop of iodine solution on the cut end. What does the blue colour indicate?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>7. <b>The growth of the bud.</b>—Watch your bud growing, and
notice that the tip of the twig—which was surrounded by the young
leaves—elongates so that each pair of leaves is soon separated from
the next pair. Notice the <i>rings</i> of <i>scars</i> which the scales left when
they fell off.</p>

<p>8. <b>A year’s growth.</b>—Look down the twig until you find the rings
or scars which were left <i>last spring</i>, when the scales fell off the
expanding terminal bud. A year ago the end of the twig was at this
point, so that the length between one such set of rings and the next
marks a year’s growth.</p>

<p>9. <b>Side branches.</b>—The buds on the length formed last summer
but one may have grown out into side twigs. Try to find the leaf scars
below each of these side twigs.</p>

<p>10. <b>A horse chestnut twig and its buds.</b>—Examine in the same
way a horse chestnut twig and trace its history. The buds are larger
than those of the sycamore, and each is covered with a shining, sticky
layer of resin. What do you think is the use of the resin? Put a bud
in water, and when you take it out notice how the water runs off and
leaves the bud dry.</p>

<p>Pull one of the terminal buds to pieces. The scales will come apart
more easily if the bud is soaked for some time in methylated spirit,
to dissolve out the resin. Notice the thick layer of down inside the
scales. What do you think is its use? Scrape the down gently, and
carefully clean it away from the little foliage leaves in the middle.
See how the leaflets of each leaf are folded. In some terminal buds you
may also find a little pink flower-spray.</p>

<p>Tie a piece of string round a growing twig, so that you can recognise
it, and watch all the stages of the expansion of the terminal bud, the
unfolding of the leaves, and the elongation of the tip (Figs. <a href="#FIG_37-38">37</a>,
<a href="#FIG_39-40"> 39 and 40</a>). Cut off other twigs two or three feet long,
in February or early March, and keep them in water in a warm room.</p>

<p>11. <b>Other buds.</b>—Examine the buds of the beech, lilac, violet,
dock, fern, etc., and make drawings showing (1) how the leaves are
arranged with regard to each other, and (2) how each leaf is folded or
rolled. As a rule these points can be easily made out by examining with
a lens the cut surface of a bud which has been cut across with a sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
knife; but the buds should also be examined at frequent intervals when
they are unfolding.</p>

<p><b>A typical bud.</b>—An excellent idea of the structure of a typical
bud can be obtained by splitting down the middle an ordinary cabbage,
or a lettuce “heart,” and examining the manner in which the leaves
crowd round and cover the conical end of the stalk. Around the tip or
“growing point” the leaves are extremely small and tender. They are
overlapped by slightly larger leaves, which spring from the stalk a
little lower down. These in their turn are covered by still larger
leaves, inserted at a yet lower level, and so on—the largest and
oldest leaves folding over the smaller and more recently formed. The
growing point of a stem, or of a branch of a stem, surrounded by a
cluster of immature leaves, is called a <b>bud</b>.</p>

<p><b>The history of a sycamore twig.</b>—The student who would know the
meaning of the various marks and scars on the surface of a twig, should
select one and follow carefully for a year the fate of the buds which
it bears. It is convenient to begin by studying a twig on a sycamore
tree. It may be marked for ease of recognition by tying a piece of tape
on it. If several students are working, each should write his name or
number on a luggage-label and fix this to his twig.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>—Sycamore leaves and fruits.<br />
      (From a photograph by Mr. A. Flatters.) (×&nbsp;¹&frasl;₁₂.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<b>The positions of the buds.</b>—In summer the younger twigs of the
sycamore tree are covered with large five-pointed leaves (<a href="#FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>).
The leaves come off in pairs, each pair being at right angles to the
pair next above or below. Every leaf is engaged throughout the day in
building up—by means of the green stuff in its interior—starch and
other foods (<a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>), and in giving off excess water, in the
form of invisible vapour, through its stomata (<a href="#Page_53">p. 53</a>).
In the axil (<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>) of
each leaf is a little bud, called from its position an <b>axillary</b>
bud (<a href="#FIG_41-42">Fig. 41</a>, <i>B</i>), and at the very tip
of the twig is a larger <b>terminal</b> bud.</p>

<p><b>Autumn colours and the fall of the leaf.</b>—As the summer wanes,
the soil becomes colder, and the chilled roots lose much of their
power of absorbing moisture. It is plain that if the leaves continued
giving off water when no fresh supplies were forthcoming the tree
would suffer. How is the danger to be met? Starch and other foods have
already been stored up in quantity sufficient to supply the needs of
the winter and the early spring. The leaves have finished their work,
and one by one they fall off. But this does not take place until
careful preparation has been made. Their green colouring matter breaks
up; the part which may still be useful to the plant drains into the
stem, leaving little heaps of yellow grains in the leaves. Or a special
colouring matter may be formed, which, united in various ways with the
materials of the dying leaf, gives the warm shades of red, orange, and
purple which make the woods so beautiful in autumn. When all is ready,
a layer of cork (<a href="#FIG_41-42">Fig. 41</a>, <i>C</i>) forms at
the junction of the leaf stalk and the twig so that no raw wound may be
left; the leaf-base splits across, just above the cork layer, and the
leaf flutters to the ground, there to rot and make rich leaf mould.</p>

<p><b>The leaf scars.</b>—The former position of each leaf is now marked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
by a curved scar (<i>l.s.</i> <a href="#FIG_34">Fig. 34</a>), and a row
of brown dots (<i>v.b.</i>) in the scar still shows where the food-pipes
bent outwards from the twig into the leaf. A line (<i>a</i>) stretches
across and joins the two scars of each pair.</p>

<p><b>The buds.</b>—Just above every scar is the bud which arose in the
axil of the fallen leaf. It is covered with overlapping scales of
light green colour. At the end of the twig is a single terminal bud,
similar in appearance to the axillary buds, but of larger size. It is
instructive to take the terminal bud of a twig to pieces. The outer
scales are tough and green, while the inner ones are thinner and have a
beautiful silvery appearance. Usually there are fourteen scales. Each
is long and narrow and bears at its upper end the rudiment of a leaf
blade, which cannot usually be seen well without a lens. The scale is
really a leaf which has been arrested in its development.</p>

       of a Sycamore bud. (×&nbsp;7.)</p>
</div>

<p>When all the scales have been removed, there remains a tiny tuft of
delicate green foliage leaves surrounded by a little down. Each leaf
is folded fanwise, both for convenience of packing, and to protect its
tender tissues from the cold and the damp when the bud is expanding.
The complicated folding of these leaves is well shown in <a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
which is a magnified sketch of a cross section through a sycamore bud. The
large sheaths surrounding the young leaves are four of the overlapping
scales. In a large terminal bud a bunch of green flowers may often be
found.</p>

<p><b>The bursting of the buds.</b>—About the middle of April the tree
wakens to new life. The stored food makes its way to the terminal
buds; invigorated by the rich sugary sap the young leaves swell and
push forward, burst apart the scales, and open out their folds to the
light and air, as if eager to get to work at the earliest possible
moment. The scales fall off to the ground, leaving close-set rings
of scars; the growing point elongates, and new leaves—which were
indistinguishable in the bud—grow out and expand. During the summer,
food is plentiful, and a little bud appears in the axil of every leaf.
Only with the autumn does the activity of the tree slow down. Except
for some two pairs at the tip, the newest leaves now remain stunted.
They form scales and close round the tender growing point protectingly,
in readiness for the winter.</p>

</div>

<p>If necessary, the axillary buds could have behaved as the terminal bud
did, in which case they would have grown out into side twigs. They
usually remain small, however, until next year (<a href="#FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>),
for the leaves are so busy making food, and the terminal bud is so busy growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
in length, that no energy can be spared for their further development.
If any accident had befallen the terminal growing point, one or more of
the axillary buds would have grown out into side twigs. Gardeners take
advantage of such reserve buds when they clip off the ends of twigs to
make a plant grow “bushy.”</p>

<p><b>A year’s growth.</b>—When the bud scales drop off they leave, as we
have seen, a series of closely-set rings of scars. The distance between
one set of rings and the next (as at R., <a href="#FIG_34">Fig. 34</a>), therefore
represents a year’s growth. The student should get a twig two or three feet long
and find out for himself, by examining the marks on it, what the twig
did last year, two years ago, and three years ago. With care he will be
able to say definitely in which year any fairly recent side-twig began
to grow out from its bud.</p>

<p><b>A horse chestnut twig.</b>—A winter twig of horse chestnut (<a href="#FIG_37-38">Fig. 37</a>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
is very similar in its general features to what we have seen in
the sycamore. The buds are in pairs at right angles to each other,
and below each bud is a large corky leaf scar (<i>l.s.</i> <a href="#FIG_37-38">Fig. 38</a>),
with the positions of the former food-pipes marked by black dots (<i>v.b.</i>).
These buds, however, are larger than those of the sycamore, and each is
covered with a shining layer of resin, to keep out insects and the rain.</p>

<p>We may slip the end of a penknife under the bud scales and remove them
one by one. The first few are thin and papery, and soaked in resin.
Those next inside are woody and much thicker. Next comes a layer of
papery scales, inside that a coat of cottony down, then another soft
papery layer, and lastly a thick pad of down. When we carefully scrape
away this down, we find—warm and cosy in its midst—a tuft of little
objects with a most quaint resemblance to hands clad in woollen gloves.
We remove one of these, and on scraping it gently with a knife we see
that the “hand” has seven fingers; and it presently becomes clear that
each finger is a tiny green leaflet folded on itself, and that the hand
is a young leaf. If we take off these gloved leaves in turn one by one,
we find as we proceed that they become smaller, until they are almost
too small to be distinguished in their fluffy nest. And when all the
down and the baby leaves are scraped away, the tender growing point
of the twig is left alone at the summit of a little cone, with steps
showing where the leaves were.</p>

<p>Had the twig been left undisturbed on the tree, the bud would have awakened in spring and begun to grow
(<a href="#FIG_39-40">Fig. 39</a>).<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The scales and the down would have been shed, leaving only the rings of
scars as a memento of the winter sleep; the growing point would have
pushed on and on, lengthening perhaps a foot or more in three weeks;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the leaves would have opened their bright green fingers to the spring
air, and begun their work (<a href="#FIG_39-40">Fig. 40</a>), only to
cease when in the autumn they too dropped off, and the new buds
tucked themselves up in their beds to go to sleep. The leaves of the
horse chestnut fall off, as do those of the sycamore, owing to a
“separation-layer” arising at the base of the leaf stalk (<a href="#FIG_41-42">Fig. 41</a>),
and in this case each leaflet also becomes separately detached in the same way.</p>

<p><b>Other forms of buds.</b>—Surrounding the young silky-fringed leaves
of the <b>beech</b> bud are several crimson membranous scales which are
really the stipules (<a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>) of undeveloped leaves. The thin, soft parts
of the leaf blade are sharply pleated (<a href="#FIG_41-42">Fig. 42</a>)
between the side veins which spring from the midrib.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The way in which the branching of a tree depends on the buds is well
shown in a lilac. The terminal bud does not usually develop, so that
each of the two lateral buds just below grows out into a branch,
producing the characteristic “forking.” In the lilac bud every
gradation between scales and ordinary foliage leaves may be seen.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">HOW STEMS DO THEIR WORK</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>11. THE DUTIES OF STEMS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The shapes of stems.</b>—Cut across a deadnettle stem and a
wallflower stem and examine the shape of the sections. The former is
square, the latter is five-ribbed. Is there any relation between the
form of the stem and the arrangement of the leaves?</p>

<p>2. <b>The “bleeding” of stems.</b>—Cut through the lower part of
a scarlet-runner plant in spring. Can you see any water escaping
from that part of the stem still in the ground? Similarly, cut back
a sunflower stem when it is from ½ to 1 inch thick. Does the water
exude from all parts of the cut surface equally, or does it come from
definite channels? To see this better, dry the cut end with blotting
paper and examine the surface with a lens. “Bleeding” is best seen in
vine stems; if a young vine is available, cut it back in spring and
observe the large escape of water.</p>

<p>3. <b>The water-current travels along definite channels.</b>—Colour
some water with red ink and put in it the stalks of cut white flowers
such as snowdrops or narcissi. The stalks and flowers soon become
veined with red. Cut the stalks across and see that the strands in the
interior are also coloured. The coloured water has evidently travelled
along definite channels.</p>

<p>4. <b>The food-channels in a soft stem.</b>—(<i>a</i>) Take a stout piece
of the stem of a deadnettle, including three nodes (<a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a>), and slit it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
down in a line between the end pairs of leaves. Then boil the stem
in water until the internal tissue is soft. Take the stem out and
carefully scrape away all the soft material until the woody strands can
be well seen. These are the <i>food-channels</i>. Notice their arrangement
in the stem, and the manner in which they run out to the leaves.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Similarly, examine the strands in a piece of sunflower stem,
and in an old cabbage stalk.</p>

<p>5. <b>The path of the water-current in a woody stem.</b>—Take a leafy
twig of elder or laurel and, from the part of the shoot below the
leaves, remove a ring of about an inch of the bark and the soft tissues
which lie beneath it, so as to expose the wood. Put the end of the twig
(below the ring) in water. The leaves remain fresh and crisp, showing
that the water travels either along the wood or the pith, or along both.</p>

<p>6. <b>The water travels along the wood.</b>—Put a similar leafy twig
of elder dipping in water which has been coloured by red ink. Expose
to sunlight, and after an hour or two cut open the twig and observe
which parts are coloured. The bark and the soft tissues between it and
the wood are not coloured. The wood is stained red. The pith is not
coloured.</p>

<p>7. <b>The path of the leaf-made food.</b>—(<i>a</i>) Take a leafy branch
of a tree—<i>e.g.</i> willow—and near the bottom remove a ring of the
bark and the soft tissues lying between bark and wood. Put the twig
in water, so that the ringed part and a few inches above shall be
immersed. After a time roots are produced <i>above</i> the cut. If any arise
from the stripped part they are few in number and much shorter than
those above.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Place a similar but uninjured twig in water, and notice that
the new roots are produced <i>at the end</i>. What is the reason for the
difference?</p>

<p><b>The duties of stems.</b>—No one can study leaves without being
impressed by the great importance to the plant of the work which they
do. Even the casual observation that year after year thousands of
fresh leaves make their appearance would indicate this. And when it is
learned that throughout the day every leaf is busily engaged in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
decomposing carbon dioxide, and joining up the carbon with the water
and mineral compounds which have come up from the root—thus forming
sugars, starch and a host of other valuable substances—some general
idea is obtained that the trunk and spreading boughs of a tree may,
after all, be of minor importance, and may exist mainly to help the
leaves to perform their duties as perfectly as possible.</p>

<p>This is the true view to take of the stem and its branches; their
duties are (1) to bear the leaves and spread them out, so that these
will receive as much sunshine and fresh air as possible; (2) to supply
the leaves with the water and mineral substances which they require for
their work; and (3) to receive from the leaves and distribute to the
rest of the plant the food materials which the leaves have prepared.</p>

<p>A stem, together with the leaves and branches which it bears, is called
a <b>shoot</b>.</p>

<p>It will be found that almost all the variations in the structure and
habits of stems are connected with the arrangements of the leaves. For
example, the weight of the mass of leaves borne by a forest tree is
very great, and they offer a great resistance to the wind; the trunk
and its branches, therefore, are correspondingly strong and stout.
Again, when a stem is ribbed or ridged in any particular manner it will
generally be found that the ridges have a definite relation to the
leaves and to their points of insertion on the stem. This has been seen
(<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>) to be the case in the stem of the wallflower.</p>

<p>The tip of a stem or branch is occupied by a <b>bud</b>. As the tip
elongates (<a href="#FIG_39-40">Fig. 40</a>), the outer leaves of the bud
become separated by internodes, and new leaves continually arise around
the growing point.</p>

<p><b>The path of the water in the stem.</b>—It may easily be shown that
water travels up the stem to the leaves. It is common knowledge that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
slightly withered leaves or flowers become fresh and crisp again if
the twig or stalk is put in water. If the stalks of white flowers—say
snowdrops or narcissi—are put into water coloured with red ink, the
flowers become veined with red, and, if the stalks are cut into, red
strands may be seen. This experiment not only shows that water has
travelled up the stalk, but it also shows that the water has passed
along <b>definite channels</b>. When a vine stem is cut back in the
spring, the water wells out rapidly from the end of that part of the
stalk which is still in the ground. This <b>bleeding</b>, as it is
called, may also be seen, though to a smaller extent, in stems of
sunflower, scarlet-runner, and other plants. By drying the cut surface
with blotting paper, and then examining it with a lens, it may be seen
that the water escapes from the ends of certain little tubes; and it
is possible in a boiled or rotting stem (Expt. 11. 4) to follow the
distribution of the strands containing these tubes. The strands run
along the length of the stem, <b>outside the pith</b>. Cross strands
connect the main ones, chiefly at the leaf-levels (nodes); and other
strands run out into the leaves to form the veins.</p>

<p>The tubes which convey the water current are in that part of the strand
which is nearest the pith, and they become woody. Thus, if the current
year’s growth of, say, a horse chestnut or an elder twig is cut across,
a thin ring of <b>wood</b> is seen surrounding the soft pith. Outside
the wood are the softer tissues, surrounded by the bark. A ring of the
bark and soft tissues beneath it may be entirely removed from a growing
twig, leaving the wood exposed, but the leaves above remain crisp and
fresh, showing that this treatment has not interfered with their water
supply. The water, therefore, travels along either the wood or the
pith. That the wood and not the pith conducts the water may be shown by
putting a leafy twig in water coloured with red ink. Only the wood is stained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The path of the food made by the leaves.</b>—The plant food which
the leaves make is drained off into the stem, and distributed to the
parts where growth is taking place. This food travels in the soft
tissue—called the <b>bast</b>—which lies below the bark. This fact
can be shown indirectly by removing a ring of bast from the lower part
of a branch, say of willow, and putting the branch into water. When at
length the cutting puts out roots, these spring from the top of the
ring. If any spring from the stripped part they are markedly smaller,
and fewer in number. In an uninjured cutting, which is of course
supplied with prepared food along all its length by the bast vessels,
such roots spring from the cut end. The supply of leaf-made food can
also be cut off by ligaturing a twig below the leaves, as by twisting
a wire or cord tightly round it. In such a case growth usually ceases
in the part of the twig below the strangled part, while the upper part
of the twig, to which the leaf-made food is now restricted, grows much
more luxuriantly than before. Gardeners often produce unusually fine
fruits by ligaturing the lower parts of the twigs on which the fruits
are ripening.</p>

<h4>12. HOW STEMS ARE STRENGTHENED.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The formation of wood.</b>—(i.) In summer take a horse chestnut
twig of three or four years’ growth. Cut through it with a sharp knife
at the following places, and trim the cut ends flat:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub3">(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; Near the apex;</li>
<li class="isub3">(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; at the middle of the current year’s growth;</li>
<li class="isub3">(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; near the bottom of the current year’s growth;</li>
<li class="isub3">(<i>d</i>)&nbsp; about the middle of last year’s growth;</li>
<li class="isub3">(<i>e</i>)<span class="ws2">”</span><span class="ws3">”</span>
                  <span class="ws2">&nbsp;the previous year’s growth.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Make a drawing of what you see in each case:—In (<i>a</i>) the
twig is covered on the outside by a green <i>skin</i>. In the middle
is the soft <i>pith</i>. Between the two is a ring of separate <i>strands</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
In (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) the strands have joined up, and a distinct, though
thin, layer of <i>wood</i> surrounds the pith. <i>Bast</i> and other soft tissues
lie between the wood and the bark. (<i>d</i>) has two layers of wood. (<i>e</i>)
has three layers of wood.</p>

<p>(ii.) Split each length longitudinally. Why is it easier to do this
than to cut the twig across? In which direction does the grain of
the wood run? Make out in each piece the pith, strands, or layers
of wood, bast, etc., and skin or bark. You can tear off the bast in
ribbon-like shreds. See how the strands run out into the young leaves.
Cut lengthwise through the junction between the main twig and any side
twigs, and notice that corresponding parts are continuous.</p>

<p>2. <b>The strength of a grass stem.</b>—Notice the relatively enormous
strength of a straw and other grass stems.</p>

<p>Burn a straw and observe the tube of mineral matter which is left
behind. Examine a piece of bamboo; is it hollow or solid?</p>

<p><b>Woody stems.</b>—To enable them to bear the weight of the leaves
and branches, and to withstand the force of the wind, the stems of
plants are strengthened in various ways. Most commonly this is effected
by the formation of <b>wood</b> in the walls of the water-vessels.</p>

<p>Even in succulent stems, such as that of the sunflower, the strands of
vessels are stiffened by the long and narrow wood pipes which run along
them; and when the strands join up to form a complete cylinder a very
strong column is the result. Engineers make use of the same device,
knowing that the same amount of material will bear a far greater stress
when made into a hollow cylinder than it will in any other form.</p>

<p><b>The thickening of woody stems.</b>—In dicotyledons (<a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>)
and gymnosperms (<a href="#Page_163">p. 163</a>) the cylinder, which is formed
by the joining-up of the conducting strands, consists of three layers. The innermost
of these is the <b>wood</b>, and the outermost is <b>bast</b>.
Between them is a very delicate layer called <b>cambium</b>, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
continually dividing and forming more wood on its inner side and more
bast on its outer side. The wood is hard and resists pressure, while
the bast is soft and is squeezed against the inside of the bark by the
expanding wood (<a href="#FIG_43">Fig. 43</a>).</p>

<p>The formation of new wood and bast takes place vigorously during the
summer, at the expense of the food which is manufactured by the leaves
and travels along the bast to the active cambium. As autumn comes,
the activity of the tree slows down, and the new wood is formed of
closer texture. In winter the process stops altogether; but with the
warmth and the plentiful food-supply of spring the formation of new,
open-textured wood is resumed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_43" id="FIG_43"></a>
    <img src="images/i_073.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="351" />
    <p class="blockquot2 no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span>—Portion of a four-year-old stem of
       the Pine, cut in winter. 1, 2, 3, 4, the four successive annual rings
       of the wood; <i>b</i>, bast; <i>br</i>, bark; <i>c</i>, cambium; <i>f</i>, spring wood;
       <i>i</i>, junction of wood of successive years; <i>m</i>, pith; <i>ms</i>, medullary
       rays; <i>s</i>, autumn wood. (×&nbsp;4.)</p>
</div>

<p>This difference in texture between the autumn wood and the later spring
wood is quite visible to the naked eye (<a href="#FIG_44">Fig. 44</a>), and gives
rise to a series of <b>annual rings</b>, each of which represents a year’s
growth. Thus, a cross cut through the four year old part of a branch
(<a href="#FIG_43">Fig. 43</a>) shows four layers of wood, one of which was
formed each year. The length formed last year has two layers of wood
(if we look in summer), and the current year’s growth has one layer,
all of which has been formed since spring.</p>

<p><b>The advantages of secondary thickening.</b>—The formation of
secondary wood and bast is very important. The new wood is required
(1) to provide additional water-vessels to supply the demands of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
increasing number of leaves, and (2) to give the necessary increase of
mechanical strength to the growing tree. Again, the increase in the
quantity of food manufactured by the leaves makes a larger quantity
of bast necessary for its distribution. Last of all, new tissues are
required to take up the duties of those which are old and worn-out.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_44" id="FIG_44"></a>
    <img src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="343" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>—Cross section
         of Larch stem, showing annual rings.</p>
</div>

<p>In forest trees, the central pith becomes almost obliterated and the
old stem practically consists of wood, bast, and bark. The various
annual rings, and the bast, of a woody stem are joined together by a
number of radiating horizontal spokes called <b>medullary rays</b>
(<a href="#FIG_43">Fig. 43</a>, <i>ms</i>, <i>ms′</i>, <i>ms″</i>, <i>ms‴</i>).
These conduct water and food materials across the stem from layer to
layer. The beautiful lines and patches called “silver grain,” which
may be seen in oak furniture, consist of the medullary rays exposed in
radial-longitudinal section.</p>

<p><b>Bark.</b>—The very young stem is surrounded by a thin waterproof
skin, perforated by stomata (<a href="#Page_53">p. 53</a>) as the skin of a leaf is;
and the part immediately below the skin possesses leaf-green, and can therefore
decompose carbon dioxide as a leaf does (<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>). An old stem, on the
other hand, is covered by a layer of tough bark (<i>br</i>, <a href="#FIG_43">Fig. 43</a>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
which splits from time to time, owing to the stretching which is caused by
the increasing thickness of the wood. The bark begins as a layer of
<b>cork</b>, which forms on the outer side of the bast. The cork cuts
off the food supply from all the external tissues, which die. Bark,
therefore, consists of the cork and the dead layers outside it.</p>

<p><b>Grass stems.</b>—The great strength of grass stems—so apparent
when we try to bend a straw—is largely due to <i>silica</i>, the substance
of which rock-crystal and ordinary sand are composed. When a straw is
burnt, this remains as a hollow cylinder of mineral matter. The great
strength of the cylindrical form has already been referred to. It is
very well seen also in a bamboo stem, and anyone who has blunted the
edge of his knife on a piece of bamboo will appreciate the additional
hardness which is given by the presence of mineral matter.</p>

<h4>13. CLIMBING STEMS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Hooking stems.</b>—Examine a bramble or a wild rose plant in
a hedge. Why does it need to climb? How does it climb? Pull a branch
and notice by what means it resists the pull. What is the shape of the
<i>prickles</i>? Do they point upwards or downwards? On what parts of the
plant are the prickles found? Notice how easily a prickle may be pushed
off, sideways. Is it as easy to tear it off lengthways? Is the prickle
a little branch, or merely an extension of the rind?</p>

<p>Contrast a prickle with the <i>thorn</i> of the hawthorn. The thorn does not
come off easily, and it contains a woody core which is continuous with
the wood of the branch. Cut lengthwise through the thorn and the branch
which bears it to see this. The thorn is a short pointed branch; it
arises in the axil of a leaf, and sometimes bears leaves itself.</p>

<p>2. <b>The ivy.</b>—Observe how the climbing stem of the ivy is
attached to a wall or tree. It puts out a line of <i>roots</i> on its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
shaded side. These roots give out a sticky fluid, which, on hardening,
fixes them to the wall.</p>

<p>3. <b>Twining stems.</b>—Watch the growth of a convolvulus seedling.
At first the young stem grows straight up, but soon the tip begins to
move round and round. Try to find out how long it takes to describe
one revolution. Put a long stick in the ground near the plant and
notice how, when the revolving stem touches the stick, the spiral is
henceforth described round the support and the stem consequently clings
to it. Lay your watch face-upward, and notice whether the stem moves in
the same direction as the hands (the “clockwise” direction), or in the
opposite (“counter-clockwise”) direction.</p>

<p>Make similar observations on the hop, honeysuckle, and scarlet runner,
and note the results.</p>

<p>4. <b>Leaf climbers.</b>—Examine a climbing tropœolum (often,
though wrongly, called “nasturtium”). Which parts of the plant clasp
the support? Watch a young plant coming up. Does the stem revolve
before the leaf stalks come in contact with the support? Compare the
<i>clematis</i>.</p>

<p>5. <b>Tendril climbers.</b>—Examine plants of sweet pea, bryony, vine,
passion flower, and cucumber. Try to find out in each case which part
has been modified to form the tendrils. Watch a plant day by day until
a free tendril grasps a support, and notice how it becomes spirally
coiled. Can you straighten the tendril by pulling, without leaving any
kinks? Why? Is the spiral of the tendril continuous, or does it change
its direction in the middle? Make a <i>continuous</i> spiral with wire, and
notice the kinks formed when the wire is straightened by pulling the
ends. Which is better for the plant in a gale of wind, a continuous or
a reversed spiral? Why?</p>

<p>Notice the sucker-like tendrils of the Virginian creeper, and the way
in which they fix the plant to the wall.</p>

<p>Plants whose stems are not strong enough to stand erect without support
must adopt some special means of spreading out their leaves to the
light and air. One of the commonest devices of such plants is that of
climbing up other and stronger plants, walls, trellis-work, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Scramblers and climbers.</b>—In the simplest cases the plant
simply scrambles over other plants. Many brambles and roses are merely
scramblers, but more often they are true climbers, weaving themselves
among their neighbours by the help of hooked <b>prickles</b> (<a href="#FIG_76">Fig. 76</a>).
The prickles point backwards, and therefore anchor the twigs firmly,
as is very evident on trying to pull a branch out of the hedge. A
prickle may easily be broken off by a side push, for it is merely an
outgrowth of the rind, and does not contain any woody core. It is so
attached, however, that it resists much greater force in the lengthwise
direction—a manifest advantage to the plant.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_45" id="FIG_45"></a>
    <img src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="445" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
The differences between such a prickle and a <b>thorn</b> like that of
the hawthorn should be carefully noticed. A thorn is really a little
twig which has remained short and become pointed at the end. It has a
core of wood which is continuous with the wood of the branch bearing
it. That a thorn is really a little branch is shown by its origin in
the axil of a leaf, and by its often giving rise to leaves and buds.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

           of Honeysuckle. (×&nbsp;¼.)<span class="ws4">&nbsp;</span>of Convolvulus. (×&nbsp;¼.)</p>
</div>

<p>The stem of the ivy climbs by means of little <b>roots</b>, which it
puts out on the side furthest from the light (<a href="#FIG_45">Fig. 45</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
These give out a sticky liquid which, on drying, cements them to the
wall or tree.</p>

<p><b>Twining</b> stems are much in advance of these. There seems to be
something approaching intelligence in the manner in which the young
stem of a hop, honeysuckle, or convolvulus, which at first grows
straight up, begins to wander round and round, tracing a spiral path
in the air until it touches a support. Then, however, as if the plant
could feel, the movement below the point of contact stops; but the
upper part of the stem still revolves and therefore twines round the
support. The stems of the honeysuckle (<a href="#FIG_46-47">Fig. 46</a>)
and the hop turn in the same direction as the hands of a clock. This
is called the “clockwise” direction. On the other hand the convolvulus
(<a href="#FIG_46-47">Fig. 47</a>) and most other twining stems are “counter-clockwise”
climbers. The stem of the bittersweet revolves indifferently in either direction.</p>

<p><b>Sensitive clasping organs</b> in their simplest form are seen in the
<i>twining leaf stalk</i> of the clematis and tropœolum; the stem itself
revolves as if to give its leaf stalks every opportunity of finding
suitable supports. The leaf stalks seize these and twine round them.</p>

<p>Most wonderful of all climbing organs are the <b>tendrils</b>. They are
well seen in <a href="#FIG_48-49">Fig. 48</a>. A part of the plant—sometimes a leaflet, as in
the pea (<a href="#FIG_27-28">Fig. 28</a>); sometimes a branch, as in the passion flower; or a
flower stalk, as in the vine—becomes modified into a thread, slight
but strong. When the end of the thread touches and then twines round
a support, the whole tendril forms itself into a spiral which, like a
wire spring, draws the plant up to the support, and can yet lengthen
and yield to the wind when necessary. In the middle of the tendril
the direction of the spiral is reversed, so that the tendril can be
straightened without being twisted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>The tendrils of the Virginian creeper do not twine, but on meeting a
wall they form round red <i>suckers</i> at the end, and attach the plant
(<a href="#FIG_48-49">Fig. 49</a>).</p>

<h4>14. CREEPING AND UNDERGROUND STEMS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>A creeping stem.</b>—Examine a plant of the ground ivy. Is the
stem strong enough to stand upright? How does it spread out its leaves
to the light and air? The stem grows along the ground, and at intervals
it gives off a pair of leaves which grow upwards, and a tuft of roots
which grow down to the ground.</p>

<p>2. <b>A runner.</b>—Is the “runner” of the strawberry of the same
nature, <i>i.e.</i> is it a continuous stem like that of the ground ivy?
When the plant is carefully examined, the creeping “stem” is seen to
be a <i>branch</i> arising in the axil of a leaf. The branch runs along the
ground for a little distance, and then roots itself and gives off a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
number of leaves. In the axil of one of these another branch arises and
runs on in the same direction. The same branch does <i>not</i> run on and on.</p>

<p>3. <b>A stolon.</b>—Follow carefully the underground part of the couch
grass and make out its connection with the main shoot. It is a branch
like the runner of the strawberry, which arises in the axil of a leaf,
and extends only to the next shoot.</p>

<p>Compare the stolons of the cinquefoil.</p>

<p>4. <b>A potato tuber.</b>—Examine a potato tuber (the part which is
eaten). Notice the “eyes.” These are buds, with scale leaves. <i>Leaves
never occur on roots</i>, so that the potato must be an underground stem.
Put a pin into every eye, and wind a thread round the tuber along the
bases of the pins. It forms a spiral. Cut the potato into halves, and
pour a drop of iodine solution on the cut surface. What is the meaning
of the blue dots which at once make their appearance? Plant a potato in
warm, moist earth, and when it has sprouted notice that each bud (eye)
has given rise to a branch.</p>

<p>5. <b>Bulbs.</b>—Cut an onion or snowdrop bulb down the middle, and
draw what you see, marking on your drawing the outer scale leaves, the
swollen bases of last year’s leaves, the young leaves in the middle,
the short, thickened stem, and the roots. Also cut other bulbs across
and again draw. What is the similarity and what is the difference
between these bulbs and such a bud as a cabbage?</p>

<p>Also examine hyacinth, tulip and daffodil bulbs. Put them in glasses
with water touching their bases, and watch them grow. What do they live
upon?</p>

<p>6. <b>A crocus corm.</b>—Obtain a few crocus “bulbs” in the early
winter. Observe the tough outer tunic springing round the edge of a
circular scar on the base. If there are any roots they come off from
the scar. Take off the tunics from one “bulb” and observe the bud or
buds at the top of the white mass inside. Other tunics cover the buds.
Cut lengthwise through the mass of the “bulb” so as to bisect the
largest bud. Separate the parts of the bud with a needle and notice
(<i>a</i>) the thin outer leaves, (<i>b</i>) the young foliage leaves, (<i>c</i>)
the flower-sheath and flower. Pour a drop of iodine solution on the cut
white mass (the stem) below the bud. It turns blue. Why?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>What is the principal difference between a crocus “bulb” and the bulb
of an onion, hyacinth, or tulip? A true bulb is mainly composed of
swollen leaves or leaf bases; in the crocus the thick, rounded stem
makes up most of the bulk. It is better, therefore, to speak of a
crocus <i>corm</i>, to indicate the difference.</p>

<p>Plant the remaining corms and examine them at intervals for a year.
Notice the formation of the roots, the lengthening of the buds, the
formation of the flowers, <i>the activity of the foliage leaves after
flowering</i> (why?), the withering of the roots and leaves in summer, and
the growth of the enlarged base of the branch into next year’s corm.</p>

<p><b>Creeping stems.</b>—Instead of climbing, many stems find that the
best method of spreading out their leaves is to creep along or under
the ground, and give off leaves and roots at intervals. Not only does
this device prevent the leaves of one node from interfering with the
light and air supply of those of the next, but the plant is continually
coming in contact with a fresh lot of soil. The ground ivy is an
instructive example of this method of growth. The stem creeps along
the ground, and at every node it gives off a pair of leaves which grow
upwards, and a tuft of roots which grow down into the ground.</p>

</div>

<p>The <b>runner</b> of the strawberry (<a href="#FIG_50">Fig. 50</a>) appears at
the first glance to grow in a similar manner. As a matter of fact, however, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
apparent stem is a <i>branch</i> arising in the axil of one of the leaves
of the last node. The branch runs along the ground and gives rise to a
new shoot, and from this another branch, springing from the axil of a
leaf, forms another runner. The same branch does not run on from shoot
to shoot.</p>

<p>The <b>stolon</b> of the couch grass (<a href="#FIG_51">Fig. 51</a>)
is somewhat similar. The erect stem of the plant is divided, as usual,
into nodes or knots (from which the narrow, sheathing leaves arise) and
internodes. Branches (stolons) spring in the axils of the lower leaves,
turn downwards, and run on underneath the soil, taking root again at
some distance from the parent plant.</p>

<p><b>Underground stems.</b>—Although the stem is usually that part of
the axis of a plant which is above ground, there are many exceptions.
The bracken fern, daisy, coltsfoot, Solomon’s seal (<a href="#FIG_52">Fig. 52</a>), and many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
other plants have stems which are ordinarily buried in the ground,
giving off leaves above and roots below. In some cases such underground
stems become much swollen with stored food-material—manufactured by
the leaves in excess of immediate requirements. In the potato, for
example, certain underground branches of the stem store up starch
to such an extent that their ends become fleshy, ovoid masses some
inches in thickness (<a href="#FIG_53">Fig. 53</a>). The true nature of these
<b>tubers</b> is revealed by the buds or “eyes” which spring upon them. The buds
are arranged spirally—as may be seen by sticking a pin into each and
joining up the pins with thread—and when the tubers are kept in a
warm, moist place, each bud grows out into a new leafy shoot.</p>

</div>

<p>The structure of a <b>bulb</b> is easily made out in the onion, tulip
(<a href="#FIG_54-55">Fig. 54</a>), hyacinth, or daffodil. When such a bulb is cut down the
middle, it is seen to be mainly composed of leaves or leaf-bases,
swollen with stored food. Inside these are the young leaves and the
flower bud, which would have expanded next season; and on the outside
are a few thin scale leaves. All these leaves spring from a fleshy
button at the base, which gives off roots below. The button is the
flattened <i>stem</i>. When a plant produces a bulb it will generally be
found that it flowers either very early or very late in the season;
that is, at a period which would not be very favourable for the work
of the leaves. The flower (<a href="#FIG_54-55">Fig. 55</a>) is produced at the
expense of the stored food in the bulb—made in excess of the requirements of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
previous season. After the plant has flowered, the new leaves work
until they have made enough food for next season’s flower, and then
they also die.</p>

<p class="space-above2">The so-called bulb of the crocus is technically known
as a <b>corm</b> (<a href="#FIG_56">Fig. 56</a>). It differs from a true bulb in
consisting mainly of a fleshy, rounded stem in which the surplus food made by last
year’s leaves is stored up. The plant is thus able to flower early, without
waiting for the new leaves to supply food. The swollen stem bears one
or more buds, and the whole is surrounded by tough tunics of scales.
When the corm begins to grow, roots are put out from the base, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
flowers and—later—the leaves of the buds expand. The foliage leaves
continue their work after flowering, and the food which they make
accumulates in the base of the former bud, which becomes swollen to
form the new corm for next year’s flower. The leaves then die down,
their bases becoming the tunics of the new corm.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"> SOME COMMON FLOWERS.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>15. A TYPICAL FLOWER.</h4>

<p><b>I. The wallflower.</b>—After noticing the general habit of growth
of a wallflower plant (<a href="#FIG_57">Fig. 57</a>), and especially the shape
and venation of the leaves, make out the following parts in one of its flowers.
On the top of the flower-stalk (called the <i>receptacle</i>) are:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_57" id="FIG_57"></a>
    <img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="413" />
     <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.</span>—Wallflower. (×&nbsp;⅙.)</p>
</div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Four small, narrow, purplish leaves, called <i>sepals</i>. The four
sepals together constitute the <i>calyx</i>. Take off the sepals one by one.
Notice that two opposite sepals are bulged out at their bases, forming
pouches containing nectar. Try to get out a small drop of nectar on the
point of a pencil and taste it.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Four showy leaves arranged in the form of a Maltese cross,
called <i>petals</i>. They are yellow, or red, or purplish in colour, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
delicately scented, and have beautiful velvety surfaces. The four
petals together constitute the <i>corolla</i>. Take off the petals one by
one.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Six <i>stamens</i>, each consisting of a greenish stalk or <i>filament</i>
surmounted by a yellow, boat-shaped body, called the <i>anther</i>. The
anther is a four-chambered box containing an enormous number of tiny
yellow grains called <i>pollen grains</i>. Two of the stamens are shorter,
and are fixed at a lower level on the receptacle than the remaining
four. Take off the stamens one by one.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A central <i>pistil</i>, shaped somewhat like a slender bottle. At
the top, where the cork would come in a real bottle, is the notched
<i>stigma</i>, slightly sticky. The neck is called the <i>style</i>, and the part
corresponding to the body of the bottle is the <i>ovary</i>. Tear open the
ovary with a needle to see the <i>ovules</i>, which in an undisturbed flower
would have become seeds.</p>

<p>Watch bees visiting flowers. Does each bee confine itself to one kind
(species) of flower at each journey, or does it visit several kinds
indiscriminately? Try to discover what the bees are doing. Avoid
alarming them.</p>

<p><b>The work of flowers.</b>—The roots, stem, and leaves of a plant do
a great deal of work, but, as it is performed for the benefit of the
plant itself, it is all, in a sense, selfish work. Plants, however,
like animals, grow old in time, and at last die. If they are not to
become extinct it is evident that they must devote part of their
energies to producing new individuals, and to sending these forth into
the world as well equipped as possible for the battle of life. This
unselfish and self-sacrificing part of a plant’s life-work is called
<b>reproduction</b>; in the higher plants it is carried out by flowers.</p>

<p><b>The structure of a wallflower blossom.</b>—The flowers of different
groups of plants vary greatly in structure, but a good general idea of
the arrangement of the parts of a flower can be obtained by examining
the blossoms of a wallflower plant (<a href="#FIG_58">Fig. 58</a>). Other
flowers may afterwards be compared and contrasted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

      section of flower; <i>D</i>, stamens and pistil; <i>E</i>, fruit; <i>S</i>,
      transverse section of stem, (×&nbsp;½.)</p>
</div>

<p>There are evidently at least eight leaves in the flower, but, unlike
the green foliage leaves, these are not arranged spirally, but stand
at nearly the same level on the end—called the <b>receptacle</b>—of
the flower-stalk. The most external leaves are four in number, small,
narrow, and purplish in colour. Each of these leaves is called a
<b>sepal</b>, and the four sepals together constitute the <b>calyx</b>
of the flower. Two opposite sepals are pouched at the base, forming
pockets, in which a sugary fluid, called nectar, collects. Before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
bud opens, the calyx is the only part of the flower which is visible.
It is probably developed in the wallflower solely for the protection of
the more delicate structures within. Next, inside the sepals, placed
alternately with them, and standing a little higher on the receptacle,
are four showy leaves arranged in the form of a Maltese cross. These
leaves are called <b>petals</b>, and the four petals together form the
<b>corolla</b>. The petals are delicately scented, and their surfaces
have a beautiful velvety sheen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_59" id="FIG_59"></a>
    <img src="images/i_091.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="339" />

      anther of a long stamen; <i>sh. st.</i>, anther of a short stamen;
      <i>pol.sac.</i>, pollen sacs; <i>Ov</i>, wall of ovary; <i>Ovl</i>, ovule. (×&nbsp;8.)</p>
</div>

<p>When the sepals and petals are removed, there remain standing on
the receptacle six <b>stamens</b> surrounding a centrally-placed
<b>pistil</b> (<a href="#FIG_58">Fig. 58</a>, D). The stamens are the male part,
and the pistil is the female part, of the flower. Each stamen consists of a
greenish stalk or <b>filament</b>, surmounted by a yellow boat-shaped
body called the <b>anther</b>. The anther is a box with four
compartments (<a href="#FIG_59">Fig. 59</a>). When it is ripe, each compartment
contains an enormous number of tiny, yellow grains called <b>pollen grains</b>;
and when the anther bursts (as it does as soon as the flower opens) its
inner face is covered by the yellow dust of the pollen.</p>

<p>The <b>pistil</b> bears a rough resemblance to a slender bottle, and
consists of three distinct parts. The neck of the “bottle,” called the
<b>style</b>, is short in the wallflower, and differs from an ordinary
bottle-neck in being solid instead of tubular. At the top of the neck,
where the cork would come in a real bottle, is a body called the
<b>stigma</b>. The stigma of the wallflower pistil is hairy, notched,
and slightly sticky, from the presence of a sugary solution which forms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
upon it. The part of the pistil, corresponding to the body of the
bottle, is the <b>ovary</b>. It contains four rows of little white
<b>ovules</b>, which are destined to become seeds capable of growing up
and forming new wallflower plants.</p>

<p>The relations of the parts of the flower are well seen in
<a href="#FIG_59">Fig. 59</a>.</p>

<p><b>Fertilisation.</b>—In order that an ovule may become a seed, its
contents must mix with the contents of a pollen grain. The fusion of
the two constitutes <b>fertilisation</b>. For fertilisation to take
place, the pollen grain must first of all gain access to the stigma
of the pistil. If this be prevented the flowers will wither without
forming ripe seeds. (This may be proved easily by Expts. <b>18</b>,
3 and <b>21</b>, 2.) The sugary solution at the top of the stigma
stimulates the pollen grains to growth, and each puts out a long tube
which grows down the style. The living matter of the grains keeps near
the tips of the tubes as these continue their journey down the style.
At length the tubes enter the ovary and find the ovules. Each ovule has
at one end a minute pore (the micropyle—<a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>), and a pollen
tube finds this and enters it. The living matter of the pollen tube fuses with
that of the ovule in the neighbourhood of the pore, and fertilisation
is effected. It is now easy to understand that the comparatively
insignificant stamens and pistil are the all-important parts of a
flower.</p>

<p><b>How the wallflower advertises.</b>—Botanists have proved that a
flower produces more, and also better, seeds when it is fertilised by
pollen from another flower of the same species. This is called <b>cross
fertilisation</b>. The wallflower relies upon bees for the transference
of the pollen from one flower to another; and it is solely to attract
them that the petals are so delicately scented and brilliantly
coloured, and that sweet nectar collects in the sepal-pouches. The
gaily coloured petals are therefore advertisement placards which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
hung out to attract the attention of bees. A bee comes to a wallflower
for the sake of both nectar and pollen—the “bee-bread.” As the bee
thrusts its proboscis down between stamens and pistil in search of the
sweet liquid in the pouches, its head is pretty certain to come in
contact with, and to brush off, some of the pollen dust hanging loose
on the inner faces of the anthers. When the bee flies off to another
wallflower and continues its search for nectar, it almost invariably
leaves some of the pollen, from the first flower, on the hairy and
sticky stigma of the second.</p>

<p>In almost all cases when a flower is brightly coloured it depends upon
the help of insects for cross fertilisation.</p>

<h4>16. THE WALLFLOWER FAMILY.</h4>

<div class="figright">
    <a name="FIG_60" id="FIG_60"></a>
    <img src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="289" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span>—Shepherd’s<br />Purse. (×&nbsp;½.)</p>
</div>

<p>1. <b>Shepherd’s purse.</b>—Compare the shepherd’s purse (<a href="#FIG_60">Fig. 60</a>)
with the wallflower. The flower is very much smaller, and white, but
the parts have the same arrangement as in the wallflower, viz., four
sepals, four petals arranged in the form of a cross, six stamens (two
short and four long), and a central pistil, all arranged separately
on the receptacle. Look down the plant, and notice that in the oldest
(lowest) flowers, everything but the pistil has dropped off, and that
this has become greatly enlarged to form a <i>fruit</i>. Cut some fruits
open, both lengthwise and crosswise, and observe that each consists
of two pocket-like chambers, separated by a thin partition on which
the seeds are borne. Notice the manner in which the oldest fruits have
opened naturally.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <b>Other relatives of the wallflower.</b>—Compare also the flowers
and fruits of the stock and candytuft, and also cress, mustard, radish
(<a href="#FIG_61">Fig. 61</a>), cabbage, and turnip, which have been
allowed to “run to seed.” Examine the roots of the turnip and radish.</p>

<p>Make a note of the earliest dates on which you see the above plants
in flower.</p>

<p><b>The wallflower family.</b>—The plants of the family to which
the wallflower belongs are of very great importance to mankind; for
while not one of them is poisonous, many are extremely valuable as
food-crops. They are all <i>dicotyledons</i>; that is, their seeds contain
two cotyledons or “makeshift leaves,” as has already (<a href="#Page_1">Chapter I.</a>)
been seen in the case of the mustard. The net-like venation of the
leaves of the full-grown plant also indicates this. There is a great
family likeness between the flowers of this group, and they are easily
recognised (<a href="#FIG_61">Fig. 61</a> <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>) by the cross-shaped
corolla and the six stamens (two short and four long). All the parts of the flower—sepals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
petals, stamens, and pistil—are fixed separately on the top of the
flower stalk or receptacle. The cross-arrangement of the petals has
led to these plants being called <b>Crucifers</b> (cross-bearers). The
<b>shepherd’s purse</b> (<a href="#FIG_60">Fig. 60</a>)—so-called from the
shape of its fruit—is a common weed with small, white flowers. All stages of the
flower may generally be found on the same plant. While at the top the
buds may still be unopened, the flowers below have been fertilised
(in this case generally self-fertilised); the sepals, petals, and
stamens—having fulfilled their duties—have fallen off; the ovules
have become seeds, and the ovule-box or ovary has become a seed-box or
fruit, consisting of two bags separated by a partition which bears two
rows of seeds on each side (<a href="#FIG_62-64">Fig. 62</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><b>Useful crucifers.</b>—The turnip and the radish are largely
cultivated for their roots (<a href="#FIG_62-64">Figs. 63 and 64</a>), and are then taken out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the ground at the end of their first season. As these plants naturally
flower in their second year of growth and then die, they are called
<b>biennials</b>. The production of flowers and fruit is a great strain
on a plant, and it is to prepare for the effort that the turnip and
radish store so much food in their roots during the first year as to
give them a globular and spindle shape respectively. A carrot is not a
crucifer, but it also adopts this device.</p>

<p>The cabbage is grown for its leaves. Varieties of the cabbage are
Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cauliflower; it is the very small
flower-buds of the last two which are eaten. Cress and white mustard
are eaten in the seedling stage. The seeds of the black mustard are
ground and eaten as a condiment.</p>

<h4>17. THE BUTTERCUP FAMILY.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The buttercup.</b>—Notice the habit of growth, characters of
the leaves, etc. Is the buttercup a dicotyledon? Make this
observation with all flowering plants. (See, however, <a href="#Page_163">Chap. VIII., p. 163</a>.)</p>

<p>In the flowers of a buttercup (<a href="#FIG_65">Fig. 65</a>) make out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) The <i>calyx</i> of five green, separate sepals; they are
the only parts to be seen in young, unopened buds. Take off
the sepals of a fully-opened flower one by one.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <i>corolla</i> of five, golden-yellow, separate
petals, alternate with the sepals. Notice the nectary—a
little pocket—near the base of the upper surface of each
petal. Take off the petals one by one and observe that they
are fixed on the receptacle, a little higher than the sepals.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The large number of separate <i>stamens</i>, inserted
still higher on the receptacle.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) On the top of the receptacle the large number of
separate, flask-shaped bodies, which together make up the
<i>pistil</i>. Each of these is called a <i>carpel</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Watch bees and other insects visiting buttercups and notice how they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
stand on the flower to obtain the nectar from the nectaries. Does a bee
on leaving go to another buttercup, or does it change to another kind
of flower?</p>

<p>In a flower from which the sepals, petals, and stamens have fallen,
notice the compound <i>fruit</i> (<a href="#FIG_66-67">Fig. 66</a>), consisting
of ripened carpels. Open a carpel with a needle and pick out the single seed.</p>

<p>2. <b>Other plants of the buttercup family.</b>—Notice that in the
anemone (<a href="#FIG_66-67">Fig. 67</a>) and marsh marigold
(<a href="#FIG_68">Fig. 68</a>), the sepals appear to be absent (the
three leaves under the anemone flower are not parts of the flower; they
are called <i>bracts</i>). The apparent petals are really the sepals; it is
the corolla which is absent. Observe the large number of stamens, and
notice that the pistil consists of several separate carpels.</p>

<p>In what kind of ground have you seen these plants growing wild?</p>

</div>

<p><b>The buttercup family.</b>—The buttercup (<a href="#FIG_65">Fig. 65</a>) and
its relatives resemble the crucifers (1) in being dicotyledons (as is indicated
(<a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>) by the venation of the leaves), and (2) in the fact
that, of the parts which compose the flower, each group is arranged separately on
the receptacle. For example, the stamens are not connected with either
the calyx, the corolla or the pistil. Having noted these points of
resemblance, however, we are met by some important differences. In the
buttercup there are usually five sepals and five petals; there may be
twenty or more stamens; and the pistil is not a single structure, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
consists of a number of separate parts, each of which is called a
<b>carpel</b>, and contains a single ovule. The pistil of a crucifer
consists of only two carpels; these are welded together into a single
structure, and until the fruit ripens a slight notch in the stigma is
the only external indication that the pistil is in two parts.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Insects visit buttercups for the sake of nectar and pollen, and whilst
creeping about the flower transfer pollen to the stigmas of the
carpels. The insects may have brought some of this pollen from other
flowers, and then cross-fertilisation is caused. If the pollen is
derived from the same flower self-fertilisation is the result.</p>

<p>After fertilisation the ovules become seeds; the sepals, petals, and
stamens drop off; and the carpels swell up, forming a dry compound
fruit (<a href="#FIG_66-67">Fig. 66</a>), consisting of several nutlets.</p>

<p>Two other common plants of this family are the <b>anemone</b> (<a href="#FIG_66-67">Fig. 67</a>)
and <b>marsh marigold</b> (<a href="#FIG_68">Fig. 68</a>). In neither of these cases has the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
flower any petals, but the calyx has taken on the appearance of a
corolla. In the marsh marigold it is large and yellow; in the anemone
it is white or purple. The three green leaves immediately beneath the
flower of the anemone are called <i>bracts</i>. They should not be mistaken for sepals.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The plants of the buttercup family are as generally poisonous as the
crucifers are wholesome. Monkshood is especially poisonous, and its
root has been mistaken, with fatal results, for that of horse-radish.
It is often noticed that grazing cattle avoid the buttercups in a
field. The bitter and disagreeable taste of the leaves is of course a
valuable protection to the plant.</p>

<h4>18. THE PEA FAMILY.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The garden pea.</b>—Notice again the habit of the plant: its
compound, net-veined leaves with large stipules, and its method of
climbing by tendrils which are modified leaflets. Examine the flower
and make out (<i>a</i>) the <i>calyx</i> of five united sepals; (<i>b</i>) the
curiously shaped <i>corolla</i>. The large upper petal is called the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
<i>standard</i>, the two at the side are the <i>wings</i>, and the lowest
(really two locked together) is the <i>keel</i>; (<i>c</i>) the ten <i>stamens</i>.
One (opposite the standard) is separate; the remaining nine have the
lower parts of their filaments united to form a tube. Slit open the
filament-tube and remove the stamens, noticing how they are attached to
the other parts of the flower; (<i>d</i>) the <i>pistil</i>. Slit open the ovary
and see the ovules in it. Watch the various stages of the formation of
the fruit (pod).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_69" id="FIG_69"></a>
    <img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="446" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>—Vetch. (×&nbsp;⅓.)</p>
</div>

<p>Watch bees visiting the flowers. The insect alights on the wings, and
its weight pulls them down and lowers the keel, bringing the stamens
against the bee’s body.</p>

<p>Cut a complete flower down the middle with a sharp knife, and notice
that calyx, corolla, and stamens seem not to be inserted separately on
the receptacle, but to spring from a common base.</p>

<p>2. <b>Other plants of the pea family.</b>—Examine also bean, vetch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
(<a href="#FIG_69">Fig. 69</a>), meadow vetchling (<a href="#FIG_70-71">Fig. 70</a>),
clover (<a href="#FIG_70-71">Fig. 71</a>), laburnum (<a href="#FIG_72-73">Fig. 73</a>),
and broom. Compare the habits of growth of the plants, and notice
that they all have the same peculiar shape of flower. Dissect a flower
of each. Notice that in laburnum and broom the ten stamens are all
united. In clover the flowers are in <i>heads</i>. Notice how the leaflets
of the clover plant close at sunset.</p>

<p>3. <b>Fertilisation.</b>—Dig up several red clover plants in early
summer and pot them. Cover about half the plants with gauze, so fixed
on wire frames that insects cannot get inside, and then put all
the plants together where they will get plenty of sun. Water them
regularly, and notice which plants ripen seed. How do you account for
the differences?</p>

<p><b>The pea family.</b>—Plants of the pea family are found in all
quarters of the earth. They are of very diverse size and habit of
growth; the laburnum, for example, is a tree; the gorse is a bush;
the broad bean has a strong, erect, herbaceous stem; the pea is a
weak-stemmed climbing plant; the clovers are small herbs with flowers
forming “heads.” Most of the members of the family agree in having
a “butterfly-shaped” corolla (<a href="#FIG_72-73">Figs. 72 and 73</a>), which consists
of three well-marked parts, viz., a large <b>standard</b>, a pair of
<b>wings</b>, and two closely-connected petals which form a boat-shaped
<b>keel</b>. There are ten stamens, and the filaments of nine of these
usually cohere to form a tube surrounding the ovary. In the laburnum,
gorse, and a few others, all the ten stamens are united. When a bee
visits the flower, in search of nectar, it alights on the “wings” of
the flower, and its weight depresses these and pulls down the keel. The
anthers of the stamens are so placed with respect to the keel that this
results in a mass of pollen being scraped off the anthers and forced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
out at the beak of the keel, or in the stamens being
suddenly liberated and scattering pollen on the bee. The
pollen sticks to the bee’s body, and some of it is almost
certainly transferred to the stigma of the next flower visited.
The quaint shape of the corolla is thus definitely adapted to
the visits of insects; for the nectar is so placed that to
obtain it the insect must carry off some of the pollen.</p>

<p>The calyx, corolla, and stamens are not obviously—as in
the wallflower and buttercup—inserted separately on the
receptacle, but seem to spring from a common base.</p>

<p>The fruit is a <b>pod</b> (<a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>), which
opens when ripe along both margins and liberates the seeds. Laburnum
seeds are poisonous, but the seeds of many other plants of the family
(peas, beans, lentils, etc.) are valuable foods.</p>

<h4>19. THE ROSE FAMILY.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The wild rose</b> (<a href="#FIG_74-75">Fig. 75</a>).—With
a sharp knife cut vertically through the middle of a wild rose. Notice
that the receptacle forms a deep cup, and that the carpels of the
pistil are enclosed in the cup. From the edge of the cup spring the
five sepals, five petals, and numerous stamens. What is the great
difference between a rose and a buttercup?</p>

<p>Trace the formation of the succulent fruit or hip from the receptacle
cup of the flower. Cut through a rose hip, and observe the ripened
carpels in the interior.</p>

<p>2. <b>The blackberry.</b>—Similarly examine a blackberry flower
(<a href="#FIG_76">Fig. 76</a>). This is still more like a buttercup,
but—as in the rose and the pea—the calyx, corolla, and stamens seem to
spring from a common base, and not to be inserted separately on the
receptacle.</p>

<p>Trace the formation of the compound fruit, and notice that each part is
like a little plum or cherry.</p>

<p>3. <b>The cherry.</b>—Similarly examine cherry blossom (<a href="#FIG_77">Fig. 77</a>).
The pistil consists of one carpel, and is fixed at the bottom of the
receptacle-cup, while the calyx, corolla, and stamens are fixed on the
margin of the cup. Trace the origin of each part of the fruit.</p>

<p>Compare the plum and apricot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>4. <b>The apple and pear.</b>—Cut vertically through an apple blossom
(<a href="#FIG_74-75">Fig. 74</a>) or pear blossom (Fig. 78), and notice that
the ovary is embedded in the receptacle, and that calyx, corolla, and stamens
are fixed on the top of this. Cut across the ovary and see the five
divisions (carpels).</p>

<p>The eatable part of the fruit is the swollen receptacle.
Compare the hawthorn.</p>

<p><b>The wild rose.</b>—The plants of the rose family are, most
commonly, woody trees or shrubs. The leaves are provided with stipules
in nearly all cases. The <b>wild rose</b> (<a href="#FIG_74-75">Fig. 75</a>) may be
taken as a type of the group. It bears a superficial resemblance to a buttercup,
but on dissection considerable difference in the arrangement of the
parts is seen. In the rose, the receptacle is urn-shaped; from the
margin of the urn spring the five sepals, five petals, and numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
stamens; while inside the urn the separate carpels of the pistil are
inserted. In the <b>blackberry</b> (<a href="#FIG_76">Fig. 76</a>), <b>raspberry</b>,
and <b>strawberry</b> the receptacle is knob-shaped, and the carpels are
arranged on the outside of the knob, somewhat as in the buttercup. Here
again, however, the calyx, corolla, and stamens differ from those of
the buttercup in seeming to arise from a common base.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The differences between the rose, blackberry, raspberry, and strawberry
are more marked when the pistil has become a fruit. The fleshy part of
the rose hip is the urn-shaped receptacle which encloses the ripened
carpels. In the case of the blackberry and raspberry the receptacle
is dry, and is surrounded by the compound fruit (<a href="#FIG_76">Fig. 76</a>, 3)
of the several bodies like little plums or cherries. The eatable part of the
strawberry fruit (<a href="#FIG_144">Fig. 144</a>) is the swollen receptacle, on the outside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of which are the little yellow nutlets derived from the carpels of the flower.</p>

<p>In the <b>cherry</b> (<a href="#FIG_77">Fig. 77</a>), <b>plum</b>,
and <b>apricot</b> the pistil consists of only one carpel, which is
enclosed in the urn-like receptacle. After fertilisation, the greater
part of the wall of the ovary becomes fleshy, and one of the two
ovules contained in it becomes a seed. The “stone” is formed from the
innermost part of the ovary wall.</p>

<p>The <b>apple</b> (<a href="#FIG_74-75">Fig. 74</a>) and <b>pear</b>
(<a href="#FIG_78">Fig. 78</a>) have their five carpels embedded in the
receptacle, and the rest of the flower stands on this part. The eatable
portion of the fruit is the swollen receptacle. The <b>hawthorn</b> has
usually only two carpels, and in the fruit the part derived from the
receptacle becomes hard and horny. In other respects it is very similar
to the apple.</p>

<p>The rose family is widely distributed, especially in temperate regions.</p>

<h4>20. THE PARSLEY FAMILY.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The poison hemlock.</b>—Examine this plant (<a href="#FIG_79-80">Fig. 79</a>)
very carefully, remembering that it is poisonous. Notice the general habit
of growth; the characters of the sheathing, compound leaves; the
hollow ribbed stem; and also the arrangement of the flowers, which is
characteristic of the family. From the top of a main flower-stalk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
several smaller stalks come off together, like the ribs of an umbrella.
From the top of each of these spring the stalklets which bear the small
white flowers. Notice the <i>bracts</i> at the points of origin of the
stalks. Examine the flowers, and watch insects visiting them. Which
insects are most commonly found on the flowers?</p>

<p>Compare the cow parsnip, the water hemlock, carrot, parsley, parsnip,
and celery, carefully noting the points of resemblance and difference.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

       <span class="ws6"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span>—Hedge Parsley. (×&nbsp;⅙.)</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>The parsley family.</b>—The plants of this family may be recognised
easily by the arrangement of the flowers. Several stalks spring
together from the top of the main flower stalk and each of these again
gives rise at its tip to a number of smaller stalks, at the ends of
which the small flowers are borne (<a href="#FIG_79-80">Figs. 79 and 80</a>). The
flowers are fertilised by the aid of insects, and as the nectar is on the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
it is accessible to small insects such as flies, beetles, etc. The
flowers are rendered more conspicuous by being placed close together.
The stems are usually hollow, and the leaves are alternate, and
generally compound, with sheathing bases. Many of the plants of this
family are very poisonous, and such should be carefully distinguished
and whenever possible exterminated.</p>

<p>The <b>poison hemlock</b> (<a href="#FIG_79-80">Fig. 79</a>) varies
in height from two to seven feet. It has a hollow stem which is spotted
with purple in the lower part, and when bruised the leaves give off a
smell like that of mice. Cattle are often poisoned by eating the plant
in hay, and children have been poisoned even by blowing whistles made
from the stem. The <b>water-hemlock</b> is extremely poisonous. It
grows along the sides of pools. The stem is hollow, and the leaflets
of the compound leaves are finely toothed. The root is a cluster of
fleshy swellings, and has unfortunately a rather pleasant taste.
Other poisonous plants of the family are the <b>water dropwort</b>
and the <b>fool’s-parsley</b>. Among the harmless and useful members
of the group are <b>celery</b> (when cultivated), <b>carrot</b>,
<b>parsnip</b>, and <b>parsley</b>.</p>

<h4>21. THE PRIMROSE AND COWSLIP.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The primrose.</b>—Examine the habit (<a href="#FIG_81">Fig. 81</a>)
of the plant, its underground stem, its spoon-shaped leaves—arranged in a
rosette—and the manner in which the flowers spring from the stem. In the flower
make out (<i>a</i>) the <i>calyx</i>, 5-pointed and with united sepals; (<i>b</i>)
the <i>corolla</i>, consisting of 5 petals united below into a tube. Tear
down the corolla-tube to see (<i>c</i>) the 5 <i>stamens</i> inserted on the
corolla-tube. In some (“thrum-eyed”) flowers the anthers are at the top
of the tube; in others (“pin-eyed”), they are halfway down; (<i>d</i>) the
<i>pistil</i>, consisting of stigma, style, and ovary. In thrum-eyed flowers
the style is short and the stigma is halfway down the corolla-tube;
while in pin-eyed flowers the style is long and the stigma is at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
top of the tube. Do you find both pin-eyed and thrum-eyed flowers on
the same plant, or does one plant bear only one kind?</p>

<p>2. <b>Fertilisation.</b>—Cover up a plant of each kind with gauze, to
keep insects from the flowers, and notice whether the covered flowers
ripen seeds like the others.</p>

<p>3. <b>The cowslip.</b>—Compare the cowslip (<a href="#FIG_83">Fig. 83</a>),
and notice that the main stalk gives off from the same point several smaller
stalks, each of which bears a flower. Observe that the cowslip also has both
pin-eyed and thrum-eyed forms of flowers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_81" id="FIG_81"></a>
    <img src="images/i_109.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="378" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span>—Primrose. (×&nbsp;¼.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>The primrose and cowslip.</b>—In the primrose we have flowers
of a type differing from all those previously considered in this
chapter. Not only are the sepals joined together to form a five-toothed
<b>calyx-tube</b>, but the five petals are also joined together to form
a <b>corolla-tube</b>, and the stamens are fixed on the corolla-tube.
There are two kinds of primroses, known to country children as pin-eyed
and thrum-eyed flowers respectively (<a href="#FIG_82">Fig. 82</a>). The two
forms grow on separate plants. In a pin-eyed primrose the style is long, and
the stigma—looking somewhat like the head of a pin—is at the top of the
corolla-tube; while the stamens are halfway down. The thrum-eyed
primroses have their stamens at the top, while the stigma of the pistil
is halfway down the tube, exactly opposite the place where, in the
pin-eyed form, the stamens are inserted. This curious state of things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
was a great puzzle to botanists until Darwin cleared up the mystery. A
bee, thrusting its proboscis down a pin-eyed primrose in search of the
nectar at the bottom, dusts it with pollen about halfway down—just in
the place which will come in contact with the stigma when the animal
visits a thrum-eyed flower. And the pollen from the thrum-eyed form
adheres to the part of the bee which will presently touch the stigma of
a long-styled flower. This beautiful and simple arrangement makes it
practically certain that each primrose shall be fertilised by pollen
from the other form. In the thrum-eyed form, however, it is possible
for pollen to fall upon the stigma and produce self-fertilisation.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
It is obvious that the cowslip (<a href="#FIG_83">Fig. 83</a>) is closely related
to the primrose. The difference lies chiefly in the character of the
flower-stalk. In the cowslip this is long, and it bears at its top
several stalklets, each of which ends in a flower. As in the primrose,
cross-fertilisation is secured by some flowers being pin-eyed (long
styled) and others thrum-eyed (short styled).</p>

<h4>22. THE DAISY AND ITS RELATIVES.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The daisy.</b>—Take up several daisy plants (<a href="#FIG_84">Fig. 84</a>)
entire, and wash away the soil from the roots. Notice how the stems—some
of which are underground—are connected together. Draw a leaf. What
advantage is it to the plant to have leaves of the shape noticed? Cut
vertically through the “head,” and notice that what is usually called
the “flower” really consists of a large number of small flowers.</p>

<p>The central or <i>disc flowers</i> are tubular. Which disc flowers open
first, those near the middle or those nearer the edge of the disc?
Pick off a flower and notice the 5-toothed corolla. Tear the corolla
down with a needle, and observe the tiny stamens (5) fixed on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
corolla-tube. The anthers are joined together. Notice the divided
stigma of the pistil. The white and pink <i>ray flowers</i> have
strap-shaped corollas. They have no stamens, but each has a pistil
like that of a disc flower. What do you think is the object of the ray
flowers being so conspicuous? Why do they close over the disc at night?</p>

<p>Notice the large number of green <i>bracts</i> below the disc.</p>

<p>2. <b>The dandelion.</b>—Compare the dandelion (<a href="#FIG_85">Fig. 85</a>).
Notice that all the flowers are strap-shaped, like the ray flowers of the daisy.
Pull one out, and make out the strap-like corolla, the five stamens
with joined anthers, and the double stigma (<a href="#FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>, 2).
Notice the tuft of fine hairs below the corolla and above the knob-like ovary.
The tuft of hairs is the top of the calyx-tube.</p>

<p>When the flowers have been fertilised, the yellow corollas wither, and
each calyx-tube elongates until it is about an inch long, the tuft
of fine hairs being still at the top (4). Blow a “clock,” and notice
how easily the fruits are detached from the disc and how slowly they
settle. What advantage is this to the plant?</p>

</div>

<p>3. <b>The thistle.</b>—Compare the thistle (<a href="#FIG_87">Fig. 87</a>).
The bracts are very prickly. Is this an advantage? Are the flowers tubular
or strap-shaped? Examine the fruits (“thistle down”) and compare with
those of dandelion.</p>

<p><b>The daisy.</b>—What is generally called the “flower” of the daisy
(<a href="#FIG_84">Fig. 84</a>) really consists of a very large number of small separate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
flowers set close together on a flattened disc or receptacle. The
group of flowers is called a <b>head</b>. On the lower surface of
the head are several green leaves, or bracts, which protect the bud
before it opens. The flowers of a daisy-head are of two kinds. The
white or pink straps set round the edge of the head are the corollas
of the ray flowers. They have no stamens, but a pistil with a divided
stigma is present in each. The disc flowers are yellow and tubular. The
corolla consists of five united petals. On it are fixed five stamens,
the anthers of which are joined together. The pistil is like that of a
ray flower. No calyx is present in either the ray or disc flowers of
the daisy.</p>

<p>The daisy is fertilised by the aid of insects which are attracted by
the strap-like corollas of the ray flowers.</p>

</div>

<p>The <b>dandelion</b> “flower” (<a href="#FIG_85">Fig. 85</a>) is also really
a head consisting of a great many separate flowers. There are often between
two and three hundred of these little flowers present in one head.
Below the head are several green bracts, and these protect the flowers
both in the bud and at night (<a href="#FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>). The flowers
of the dandelion are all of one type. The corolla is strap-shaped
(<a href="#FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>, 2), and of a
beautiful yellow colour to attract insects. On the end of the strap may
be seen five small teeth which indicate that it really consists of five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
united petals. At the base of the corolla is a tuft of fine hairs,
which is the top of the calyx-tube, and at the bottom of the flower
is a little white knob—the ovary. The five stamens are fixed on the
inside of the corolla-tube. Their anthers are united to form a tube
through which the upper part of the style, and the forked stigma
protrude.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that a dandelion flower is practically like a ray
flower of a daisy, with the addition of calyx and stamens.</p>

<p>The <b>thistle</b> (<a href="#FIG_87">Fig. 87</a>) is another common member
of the family. Its bracts are prickly, and are a protection from the attacks of
animals. The flowers (<a href="#FIG_88">Fig. 88</a>) are all tubular. The common
thistle distributes its fruit by a plume of radiating fine hairs—the calyx.
The fruit is commonly known as “thistle down.”</p>

<p>The <b>Compositae</b>, as plants of this family are called, are found
in all parts of the world. The family is the largest in the vegetable
kingdom, and many of the plants included in it are of considerable
importance.</p>

<h4>23. THE FOXGLOVE FAMILY.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The foxglove.</b>—Examine a flowering plant of foxglove (<a href="#FIG_89">Fig. 89</a>).
Notice the general habit of growth. In the flower make out the
five-lobed calyx, the irregular corolla with five petals joined to form
a tube, the four stamens (two long and two short) fixed on the corolla
tube (<a href="#FIG_90">Fig. 90</a>), and the form and attachment of the pistil. Watch bees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
visiting the flower. 2. <b>The speedwell.</b>—Compare the speedwell
(<a href="#FIG_91">Fig. 91</a>), and notice that the corolla is more nearly regular
than is the case with the foxglove, that it consists of <i>four</i> combined petals,
and that <i>two</i> stamens are fixed upon it.</p>

<p>3. <b>The musk.</b>—Compare the musk. Dissect a flower and notice the
forms and positions of the parts. Especially examine the pistil with
its two-lobed stigma. With a hair, carefully touch one of the lobes of
the stigma of a growing flower and watch how the lobes close. Do the
lobes open again? Put a little pollen on, and watch to see if this time
the lobes open again after closing.</p>

<p>Watch insects visiting the flowers and try to make out how the
pollination of the stigmas is brought about.</p>

<p><b>The foxglove family.</b>—In the primrose and the disc-flowers
of the daisy are seen examples of regular, dicotyledonous flowers
with five petals fused to form a corolla tube, and with five stamens
inserted on the corolla. In the strap-shaped flowers of the dandelion
the corolla is irregular, but still consists of five fused petals and
bears the five stamens.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_89" id="FIG_89"></a>
    <img src="images/i_115.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="392" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.</span>—Foxglove, (×&nbsp;⅙.)</p>
</div>

<p>The <b>foxglove</b> (<a href="#FIG_89">Fig. 89</a>) and its relatives have also
irregular corollas of joined petals on which the stamens are fixed; but the
stamens are usually only four in number, two being long and two short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
as in <a href="#FIG_90">Fig. 90</a>, <i>b</i>. In the foxglove the stamens ripen
and shed their pollen before the pistil of the same flower is mature. This prevents
self-fertilisation, but bumble bees in passing from one flower to
another convey the ripe pollen of the younger flowers to the stigmas of
flowers which are ready for fertilisation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The pretty blue <b>speedwell</b> (<a href="#FIG_91">Fig. 91</a>) is closely related
to the foxglove, but its corolla has only four lobes instead of five, and some
times these seem of almost equal size at the first glance. Generally,
however, the corolla is very plainly irregular. The speedwell has only
two stamens, while <b>mullein</b> has five.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_91" id="FIG_91"></a>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>—Speedwell. (×&nbsp;½.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Calceolaria</b>, <b>musk</b>, <b>gloxinia</b>, and
<b>snapdragon</b>—other members of the family—are often cultivated in
gardens.</p>

<p>The flowers of the musk are especially interesting, because they show
so well what is called <b>irritability</b>,—the power which all living
things possess of acting in a definite manner in response to a definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
irritation or stimulus. We have already seen good examples of
plant-irritability in the way a climbing stem winds itself round a
support. The stigma of the musk flower has two flaps. If these are
touched with a hair or bristle they quickly close together, but
presently open again as if they had found out that they had been
tricked. When, however, a little pollen is put on the flaps they close
finally, for their whole object is accomplished.</p>

<p>Some of the plants in this family are poisonous, the foxglove being
especially so in all its parts.</p>

<h4>24. THE LABIATES.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The deadnettle.</b>—Examine a deadnettle plant (<a href="#FIG_92">Fig. 92</a>).
Notice the habit of growth, and write down a description of the shape and
appearance of the stem and leaves. What is the shape of the flower? How
many sepals, petals, and stamens has it? Do the stamens ripen first, or
does the pistil? What insects do you find visiting the flower? Try to
find out how they pollinate the stigma.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_92" id="FIG_92"></a>
    <img src="images/i_117.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="380" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.</span>—White Deadnettle. (×&nbsp;⅙.)</p>
</div>

<p>2. <b>Other labiates.</b>—Compare the sage (especially in respect
of its relation to bees), rosemary, thyme, marjoram, and mint, and
distinguish between their various flowers, leaves, and scents.</p>

<p><b>The labiates.</b>—The deadnettle is a type of an easily recognisable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
family of plants. The stem is square in section, and the leaves are
arranged upon it in opposite pairs at right angles to each other.
The plants are hairy and have distinctive odours. The aroma of
<b>thyme</b>, <b>mint</b>, <b>marjoram</b>, <b>sage</b>, etc., has led
to the plants being used for flavouring food. None of the labiates is
poisonous.</p>

<p>The shape of the flower is very characteristic, and is specially
adapted to the visits of bees. The flowers are so modified that the
lowest part of the corolla forms a platform on which the bee may
conveniently alight, while the upper petals unite into an arched roof
which protects the pistil and stamens.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_93" id="FIG_93"></a>
    <img src="images/i_118.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="270" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span>—Pollination of the
       Sage by a bumble bee.<br />For explanation see text. (×&nbsp;1.)</p>
</div>

<p>The mechanism of cross-pollination is particularly well shown in the
case of the <b>sage</b> (<a href="#FIG_93">Fig. 93</a>). The flower contains four
stamens, but two of these have lost their use, and the others are modified in a
strange manner. The whole stamen has somewhat the shape of a capital
T, and at each end of the cross-piece is a pollen box. Usually the
cross-piece (<i>c</i>, <a href="#FIG_93">Fig. 93</a>, 3) is not at right angles to
the filament, but is swung up—the junction acts as a hinge—until it is nearly
vertical (<a href="#FIG_93">Fig. 93</a>, 4). The pollen box <i>s</i>, which is at the
lower end of the cross-piece <i>c</i> when this is vertical, contains hardly any pollen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The entrance to the honey tube is thus guarded by two pillars, the
filaments (<i>f</i>) of the stamens; and the lower pollen box (<i>s</i>) of the
cross-piece of each stamen is directly in front of the bee’s head as it
stands on the lower lip of the flower. When it pushes forward its head
to reach the nectar it comes in contact with the lower pollen boxes,
and the cross pieces swing round on their hinges, bringing the upper
pollen boxes down with a smack on the bee’s back (<a href="#FIG_93">Fig. 93</a>, 1),
and sprinkling it liberally with pollen dust. Having shed their pollen the
stamens shrivel up, and the pistil comes to maturity. As the pistil
ripens, the stigma arches over (<a href="#FIG_93">Fig. 93</a>, 2) so as to scrape
along the back of any bee visiting the flower for the nectar, and thus to wipe
off the pollen which has been brought from a younger flower.</p>

<h4>25. THE LILY AND SNOWDROP FAMILIES.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The hyacinth.</b>—Take up a plant (<a href="#FIG_94-95">Fig. 94</a>) entire
and notice the underground bulb with roots springing from its lower surface, and
the long narrow leaves. Is the venation of the leaves parallel or
net-like? Is the hyacinth a monocotyledon or a dicotyledon? See the
bract at the base of each flower-stalklet.</p>

<p>Examine the flower. Its leaves cannot be distinguished into calyx
and corolla, but are quite similar to each other in size, shape, and
colour. They are therefore called the <i>perianth</i>. The perianth leaves
are united to form a tube. Tear down the tube to see the six stamens
fixed on it. Are they all on the same level? Examine the pistil and cut
the ovary across to see the ovules in the three joined carpels. Which
is fixed at the higher level, the perianth or the base of the pistil?</p>

<p>2. <b>Other plants of the lily family.</b>—Examine also the white
lily, tulip, star of Bethlehem, and lily of the valley, and notice that
in spite of small differences they are all monocotyledons (how do you
know this?) and all have the <i>perianth fixed below the ovary</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <b>The snowdrop.</b>—Compare and contrast the snowdrop (<a href="#FIG_94-95">Fig. 95</a>).
Make out that it is a monocotyledon, but that its <i>perianth is inserted
above the ovary</i>. This is the great point of difference from the lily
family. Notice also how the stamens are fixed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         <span class="ws6"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span>—Snowdrops. (×&nbsp;¼.)</span></p>
</div>

<p>4. <b>Other plants of the snowdrop family.</b>—Examine the daffodil
(Figs. <a href="#FIG_54-55"> 55</a> and <a href="#FIG_96"> 96</a>)
and narcissus. Arising from the short perianth tube of the daffodil
is a longer one which is often mistaken for a corolla; it is called
the <i>corona</i>. None of the flowers hitherto described contains anything
corresponding to a corona. The corona in the narcissus is short. As in
the snowdrop, the perianth is fixed <i>above</i> the ovary. Observe how the
stamens are fixed, and notice the dry leaf beneath the flower.</p>

<p><b>The lily family.</b>—Either the <b>wild hyacinth</b> (<a href="#FIG_94-95">Fig. 94</a>)
or the cultivated single hyacinth may be taken as a good representative of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
this family. The first point which strikes the student on examining the
general “habit” of the plant is the character of the long sheathing
leaves. Their veins do not form an obvious network, such as is
seen in the leaves of dicotyledons, but run lengthwise and roughly
parallel to each other in the manner characteristic of grasses and
other monocotyledons (<a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>). The leaves are narrow, and
are not divided into blade and stalk; they and the flower stalk spring from
an underground bulb (<a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>) which consists chiefly of the
swollen leaf-bases of a previous season. A separate calyx and corolla are not
to be distinguished in the flower; the six leaves being all alike in
size, shape, and colour. These six leaves hence receive a special name,
and are called the <b>perianth</b>. The perianth leaves are united into
a tube, on the inside of which the six stamens are arranged in two
series of three each. In the middle of the flower, and fixed <i>above
the insertion of the perianth</i>, is the pistil, which consists of three
united carpels.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_96" id="FIG_96"></a>
    <img src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="334" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 96.</span>—Daffodil flower,<br />
          cut down the middle. (×&nbsp;⅔.)</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that the parts of the flower are in threes. There
are six united perianth leaves (three inner and three outer), six
stamens (also in two series), and three united carpels. This is very
common—though by no means universal—in monocotyledons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>All the plants of the lily family—including the tulips, the true
lilies, lily of the valley, asparagus, onion, etc.—agree in being
monocotyledons, and in their flowers having a conspicuous perianth (for
attracting insects) and six stamens, and in the ovary being above the
insertion of the perianth.</p>

<p><b>The snowdrop family.</b>—Plants of this family are very similar to
those of the lily family; in fact in only one respect can any sharp
line of demarcation be drawn between the two groups; in the snowdrop
and its relatives the other parts of the flower stand <i>upon the ovary</i>
(<a href="#FIG_96">Fig. 96</a>). The flowers of some plants of the family,
<i>e.g.</i> the daffodil, possess a tubular outgrowth of the perianth, which
is called a <b>corona</b>. It is often mistaken for a corolla.</p>

<p>26. THE ARUM LILY.</p>

<p>1. <b>The cuckoo-pint.</b>—Examine the habit of the plant, and then
cut open the “flower.” You will probably find a number of small flies
inside. Examine the central rod and make out the stamens and pistils on
it. Which ripen first?</p>

<p><b>The arum</b> “<b>lily</b>,” with its humble relative the cuckoo-pint
(<a href="#FIG_97">Fig. 97</a>), merits special mention; for, in the first place,
it is not a lily at all, and secondly, it furnishes an extremely interesting
example of pistils coming to maturity before anthers, which is rather
rare.</p>

<p>What is generally called the “flower” of the cuckoo-pint, or “lords and
ladies,” consists of a big curled leaf with a purple rod sticking up in
the middle. Near the bottom of the rod, but hidden from sight by the
lower part of the leaf, the true flowers arise. The chamber containing
them is shut in by a series of stiffish hairs which point downwards.
Below the hairs the rod supports a series of anthers and, near the
bottom of the chamber, several pistils. On cutting open the chamber one
nearly always finds a number of small flies, covered with pollen, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
they have brought from another arum. The flies get in easily enough,
but once in they are prisoners, for the down-pointing hairs prevent
them from getting out again. The pistils near the bottom of the rod
ripen, and are fertilised by the pollen the flies have brought. After
a time the anthers above ripen and shed their welcome pollen on the
hungry captives. Soon after this the hairs at the top of the chamber
shrivel up, and the flies, once more covered with pollen, are at
liberty to return to the outer world and, untaught by experience, to
repeat the experiment on another “flower.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"> GRASSES.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>27. THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A GRASS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>General features.</b>—Pull up a sod of couch grass or of
Yorkshire fog and clear away the earth as well as possible. Notice the
fibrous, creeping branches or <i>stolons</i>, and the bunches of fine roots.
In summer the plant sends up also erect branches called <i>haulms</i>, which
bear leaves and flowers. Examine the shape of the leaves and notice
their parallel venation, which indicates (<a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>)
that the plant is a monocotyledon.</p>

<p>Observe how the leaves are borne on the haulms. Each leaf arises at a
knot (node) which is slightly swollen. The first part of the leaf is
a <i>sheath</i> which encloses the haulm up to perhaps the next knot. Then
the leaf-blade stands out from the haulm. Turn back the blade slightly
and notice at this point a little strap, the <i>ligule</i> (<a href="#FIG_98">Fig. 98</a>),
on the upper surface of the leaf-blade. Notice the variation in the size and
shape of the ligules of different kinds of grass.</p>

<p>Pull the haulm until it gives way, and draw the broken part out of the
leaf-sheaths. Chew the end, and notice the taste of sugar. Cut across
haulms of various ages. The young haulms are solid; the old ones are
hollow except at the nodes, where there is a horizontal shelf. Notice
this also in a bamboo cane, which is the haulm of a large tropical
grass. In spring, mark a young haulm, so that you can recognise it, and
measure it day by day. Note the measurements made on various days, and
also the date of opening of the flowers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <b>Different grasses.</b>—Learn to recognise different grasses,
not only by the way in which the clusters of flowers are borne on the
haulms (Figs. 102 to 110) and by their colours, but also by the general
appearance of the plant when it is not flowering; the size and shape of
the leaves, the character of the ligules, the manner of rooting, etc.</p>

<p>Again germinate grains of wheat, and especially notice the single
cotyledon, the leaves, and roots (<a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>).</p>

<p><b>Importance of grasses.</b>—It is impossible to over-estimate the
value to man of the various grasses. From the earliest times he has
obtained his staple food from the grains of such cereals as wheat,
barley, oats, rice, and maize; and his flocks and herds have grazed
upon the nutritious herbage of the plains. The numberless applications
of such large tropical grasses as the bamboo and the sugar-cane are
also well known. Sugar occurs very generally in grasses. It can easily
be recognised even in ordinary meadow-grass by pulling out the upright
“stem” from the sheathing leaves, and chewing the tender end.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The general characters of grasses.</b>—In this country, grasses are
usually herbs not more than three or four feet high. They have abundant
leaves, which are long, narrow, and pointed at the end; they have
parallel veins like the leaves of most other monocotyledons. The roots,
too, are of the usual monocotyledonous type—springing in bunches from
the base of the stem, not branching from a main tap-root. Most grasses
spread by prostrate creeping branches or <b>stolons</b> (<a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a>),
which spring from the axils of leaves and then run along beneath the soil.
At some little distance from the parent shoot, the stolon forms roots
below and a new shoot above. Other stolons arise in the axils of the
leaves of the new shoots, and so the process is repeated. In this way
such grasses become thoroughly established in the soil, and—if they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
are of the undesirable species which are classed as “weeds”—cause much
trouble. This habit of growth is, however, useful in binding together
the sand and earth of embankments, etc., into a compact mass. The new
shoots of stolon-bearing grasses are of two kinds. Throughout the
greater part of the year they consist of tufts of leaves; but, in the
spring and summer, there are also produced erect branches—commonly
known as stems, but better called <b>haulms</b>—which bear leaves in
the “alternate” manner. The point at which a leaf springs from the
haulm is called a knot or node; it is usually swollen. The distance
between two knots is, of course, an internode. Extra roots are often
given off from the lower nodes of the haulm.</p>

<p>The lowest part of the <b>leaf</b> is a cylindrical, and generally
split, sheath (<a href="#FIG_98">Fig. 98</a>), which closely embraces the haulm
for some distance—often for the length of an internode. The sheath protects
and supports the soft, growing internode, inside it. At the top of
the sheath is the blade of the leaf, which stands out from the haulm.
At the junction of the blade and sheath, on the upper surface of the
leaf, is a little membranous outgrowth called a <b>ligule</b> (<a href="#FIG_98">Fig. 98</a>,
<i>l</i>). It often varies greatly in size and shape in different species
of grasses, and is a valuable means of distinguishing between them. Its
use is not certainly known. The student should examine the ligule of
every grass he studies.</p>

<p>The haulm, or flowering branch, is for some time short and solid, and
its nodes are so close together that the sheath of a lower leaf may
overlap several upper leaves. The haulm is thus protected from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
rough weather of the early spring. In the meantime, the flowers have
been developing at its upper end. When they are almost ready to open,
the haulm begins to grow very rapidly; its internodes elongate so
quickly that the internal tissues are torn and the haulm becomes a
hollow straw, except at the nodes, where there are horizontal shelves.
The haulm hardens and stiffens as it grows, so that, when the spikelets
of flowers at its upper end open, they are carried high above the
leaves on a slender but very strong rod, which bends and dances in the
wind, and allows the pollen to be detached and blown to the stigmas of
other flowers.</p>

<h4>28. THE REPRODUCTION OF A GRASS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The arrangement of the spikelets.</b>—Gather ears (flowering
haulms) of several different kinds of grasses and notice the
arrangement of the flowers. In the oat (<a href="#FIG_99">Fig. 99</a>),
the meadow grasses (<a href="#FIG_102-103">Fig. 103</a>), fescues (<a href="#FIG_102-103">Fig. 102</a>),
and others, the nodding oval bodies, called <i>spikelets</i>, are
borne on delicate stalks which spread outwards from the haulm. In the
foxtails (<a href="#FIG_104-105">Figs. 104 and 105</a>), timothy
(<a href="#FIG_106">Fig. 106</a>), and sweet vernal grass (<a href="#FIG_109-110">Fig. 110</a>)
the spikelets are on short stalks, which can, however, be seen on
bending the ear sharply on itself. In wheat, barley, couch grass, rye,
and rye grasses (<a href="#FIG_109-110">Fig. 109</a>) the spikelets are
devoid of stalks and are set close along the haulm. <i>Be quite sure you
understand what is meant by a spikelet.</i> 39 spikelets are shown in
<a href="#FIG_99">Fig. 99</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.</span>—Panicle<br />of Oats. (×&nbsp;¼.)</p>
</div>

<p>2. <b>The arrangement and structure of the flowers.</b>—Take an open
spikelet from the ear of a grass (<i>e.g.</i> oat) which has large flowers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and examine it. At the bottom are two boat-shaped leaves—really
bracts—called <i>glumes</i>. Remove them carefully. Above them will be
found two or more flowers, each flower enclosed in two other leaves.
The outer of these two leaves is called the <i>outer pale</i>; the inner
is the <i>inner pale</i>. From the middle of the back of the outer pale of
the oat springs a bristle called an <i>awn</i>. Remove the outer pale and
make out the three <i>anthers</i> on long filaments, and the ovary with two
branching feathery <i>stigmas</i> and short styles. <a href="#FIG_100">Fig. 100</a>
is a diagram of a spikelet, which makes clear the relation of the
glumes, pales, and flowers. <a href="#FIG_101">Fig. 101</a>, <i>A</i>,
is a spikelet of meadow fescue. Its outer pales differ from those
of the oat in not bearing awns. Otherwise it is very similar.
<a href="#FIG_101">Fig. 101</a>, <i>B</i>, shows the appearance (magnified) of
a flower of meadow fescue from which the outer pale has been removed.
The two little scales seen in front of the ovary possibly represent
a perianth. Be careful not to confuse the terms ear, spikelet, and
flower. The ear consists of a number of spikelets, and each spikelet
consists of glumes and one or more flowers.</p>

<p>Similarly dissect spikelets and flowers of other grasses, making notes
of the lengths of the stalks of the spikelets, and the presence (and
lengths) or absence of awns.</p>

<p>3. <b>The use of the awns.</b>—Try to find out the use of the awns.
Are they generally rough or smooth? Have you ever seen grass “seeds”
sticking in the wool of sheep? What kept them attached?</p>

<p>4. <b>Grain.</b>—Examine several kinds of grass “seeds” and make
out that they not only consist of the entire ripened ovary and are
therefore <i>fruits</i>, but that usually the pales also remain attached to
them.</p>

<p>5. <b>The embryo and endosperm.</b>—Again cut through soaked grains of
maize and wheat, and make out the embryo and endosperm (<a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>).</p>

<p><b>Grass flowers.</b>—Grasses are true flowering plants; but because
they depend on the wind for the transference of pollen to the stigmas,
they do not pander to the taste of bees and butterflies by secreting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
nectar, and hence have no need to display those advertisement placards
which we call petals. For this reason their flowers are not generally
recognised as such. It requires a little care to make out the parts
of the flower and to understand the manner in which the flowers are
arranged among themselves.</p>

<div class="figleft">
    <a name="FIG_100" id="FIG_100"></a>

        the outer and inner<br />pales; <i>B</i>, flower.</p>
</div>

<p>The whole group of flowers borne by any one haulm is generally called
the <b>ear</b> or <b>panicle</b>. The ear in its turn consists of
several bodies called spikelets. The appearance of the ear varies
greatly in different grasses (Figs. 102 to 110) according as the stalks
of the spikelets are long and spread outwards from the haulm, as in the
meadow-grasses (<a href="#FIG_102-103">Fig. 103</a>), oats
(<a href="#FIG_99">Figs. 99</a> and <a href="#FIG_107-108"> 108</a>),
fescues (<a href="#FIG_102-103">Fig. 102</a>),
and others; short, as in the foxtails (<a href="#FIG_104-105">Figs. 104 and 105</a>),
timothy (<a href="#FIG_106">Fig. 106</a>), and sweet vernal grass
(<a href="#FIG_109-110">Fig. 110</a>); or absent altogether, as
in the wheat, barley, rye, rye grasses (<a href="#FIG_109-110">Fig. 109</a>),
and couch grass.</p>

<p>A single <b>spikelet</b> of a grass is shown diagrammatically in <a href="#FIG_100">Fig. 100</a>.
At the bottom are two boat-shaped bracts called <b>glumes</b>
(<i>g</i>, <i>g</i>), which almost or entirely cover the spikelet before it
opens. When the glumes have been removed a few flowers remain. Each
one is protected by two leaves called <b>pales</b>: outer (<i>p₁</i>)
and inner (<i>p₂</i>) respectively. The flower (<i>B</i>), as a rule, has
<i>three stamens</i>, the anthers being borne on long filaments and dangling
out to the wind (<a href="#FIG_101">Fig. 101</a>), and a pistil with two branching feathery
<i>stigmas</i>. In many grasses the outer pale bears a bristle called an
<b>awn</b>, well seen in “bearded” wheat, barley, and upright brome grass.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_101">Fig. 101</a>, <i>A</i>, represents a single spikelet of meadow fescue, with two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
open flowers. The outer pales of this grass are not awned. <a href="#FIG_101">Fig. 101</a>,
<i>B</i>, shows a single flower of the same grass from which the outer pale
has been removed. The two little scales seen in front of the ovary (and
at <i>e</i> in <a href="#FIG_100">Fig. 100</a>) possibly represent all that
is left of a perianth (<a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>).</p>

<p><b>Fertilisation.</b>—By the time the flowers have opened, the haulm
has usually grown so tall that they are lifted well above the leaves.
The stamens hang their anthers loosely out to the wind, and, as the
slender haulm sways in the breeze, the pollen is readily detached and
carried to other flowers, perhaps miles away.</p>

<p>It is in order to catch the wind-borne pollen-grains that the stigmas
of grasses are branched and feathery. A great waste of pollen is
obviously entailed by this method. But on the other hand it must
be remembered that insect-pollinated flowers have to pay for their
privileges by storing nectar in cunningly hidden pockets, and by
advertisement-expenses, all of which the grasses avoid.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_101" id="FIG_101"></a>

           <i>B</i>, a flower from which the outer pale has<br />been removed (×&nbsp;6).</p>
</div>

<p>The ovule is fertilised in the usual way, by a pollen tube growing down
the style from a grain on the stigma. As a result of fertilisation the
ovary becomes a fruit containing one seed which fills it. In many cases
(<i>e.g.</i> barley and oats) the pales still remain in position and adhere
to the fruit. When the awn is present it may play an important part
in distributing the “seeds” by clinging to the hides of animals, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Sometimes the awn is of use in fixing the grain in position on the
ground until the seed has germinated.</p>

<p>The structure of a grass seed has already (<a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>) been studied in the
wheat and maize. The developing embryo (<a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>) lives upon a store of
food called the endosperm (<a href="#FIG_16">Fig. 16</a>) until its roots
and leaves are sufficiently advanced to make food for themselves.</p>

<h4>29. SOME COMMON GRASSES.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The fescues.</b>—Gather plants of <i>meadow fescue</i>, and examine
the habit of growth (in tufts), the broad leaves, and the nodding
panicles and the flowers. Also examine the “seeds.”</p>

<p>Compare <i>sheep’s fescue</i> (<a href="#FIG_102-103">Fig. 102</a>),
and notice the very fine leaves. The outer pales are awned.</p>

<p>2. <b>The meadow grasses.</b>—Examine the various species of meadow
grass (<a href="#FIG_102-103">Fig. 103</a>). They can be distinguished
from each other by the characters of the ligules. Notice the tree-like
habit of the panicles and compare them with the fescues. The meadow
grasses never bear awns. Notice the woolly “webs” at the bases of the “seeds.”</p>

<p>3. <b>The foxtails.</b>—In <i>meadow foxtail</i> (<a href="#FIG_104-105">Fig. 104</a>)
notice the prostrate stolons and large succulent leaves. Does the grass grow in
tufts? Why not? What is the earliest date on which you have seen it
in flower? Double the ear on itself to see the short stalks of the
spikelets. How many flowers are there in each spikelet? Notice the
silky awns of the flowers.</p>

<p>Compare the <i>slender foxtail</i> (<a href="#FIG_104-105">Fig. 105</a>),
which is a troublesome weed.</p>

<p>4. <b>Timothy.</b>—Compare the leaves and flowers of timothy or
“meadow catstail” (<a href="#FIG_106">Fig. 106</a>) with the meadow foxtail.
The ear is green and rough, and the flowers are awnless. What is the
date of flowering?</p>

<p>5. <b>Yorkshire fog.</b>—Notice the woolly covering of this weed
(<a href="#FIG_107-108">Fig. 107</a>). This covering and its bitter
flavour make it distasteful to cattle. Observe the “kneed” awn of the
flower. Dig up and shake off the earth from a sod to see the stolons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <b>Wild oat</b> (<a href="#FIG_107-108">Fig. 108</a>). Examine
the large spikelets and make out the long twisted awn of the flower.
Compare this weed with the <i>cultivated oat</i> (<a href="#FIG_99">Fig. 99</a>)
and with the <i>yellow oat grass</i>.</p>

<p>7. <b>The perennial rye grass.</b>—Notice that the ear is flattened,
and that the spikelets are without stalks and have only one glume. The
leaf is glossy and has a prominent midrib and a flattened sheath.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_102-103" id="FIG_102-103"></a>

         (×&nbsp;⅙.)</span></p>
</div>

<p>8. <b>Sweet-scented vernal grass.</b>—Notice the tufted habit of
growth and the characters of the leaves. Chew the stalk and notice the
sweet odour of new-mown hay. What is the date of flowering? Make out
that the flower has two stamens only.</p>

<p>9. <b>Rushes and sedges.</b>—Rushes and sedges are sometimes mistaken
for grasses. Examine the stems, the flowers, and the leaves (look for
ligules), and tabulate as many differences from the true grasses as possible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>The student should learn to recognise the common grasses and to
distinguish the useful species from the weeds. When the grasses are in
flower there is not much difficulty in doing this, but the habit of
growth—the characters of the leaves and roots, and of the stolons of
the perennial species—should also be noticed carefully, as during the
greater part of the year these alone can be depended upon.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_104-105" id="FIG_104-105"></a>

     <span class="ws6"><span class="smcap">Fig. 105.</span>—Slender Foxtail. (×&nbsp;⅙.)</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>The fescues</b> fall into two groups according as their leaves
are broad or narrow. The <b>meadow fescue</b> is a good example
of the former group. It is found in meadows and pastures and has
long broad leaves. <b>Sheep’s fescue</b> (<a href="#FIG_102-103">Fig. 102</a>)
is a good example of the second group of fescues. It has very fine—almost
bristle-shaped—leaves. Like the meadow fescue it grows in tufts; it
inhabits high lands and downs, especially in limestone districts. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
nodding spikelets are borne on fairly long stalks, and the panicles are
somewhat like those of the meadow grasses (<a href="#FIG_102-103">Fig. 103</a>).
The flowers of sheep’s fescue, however, bear short awns.</p>

<p><b>The meadow grasses</b> much resemble the fescues in general
appearance, but the panicles (<a href="#FIG_102-103">Fig. 103</a>)
are rather more tree-like—the stalks of the spikelets spreading more
horizontally—and the flowers are never awned. The various species
can be distinguished by their ligules; for example, the ligule of
the <b>smooth-stalked meadow grass</b> (<a href="#FIG_102-103">Fig. 103</a>)
is blunt, while that of the <b>rough-stalked</b> species is long and
pointed. The <b>annual meadow grass</b> is a weed to be found almost everywhere.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><b>The foxtails</b> are easily recognised by the tail-like appearance
of the ears (<a href="#FIG_104-105">Figs. 104 and 105</a>).
The <b>meadow foxtail</b> (<a href="#FIG_104-105">Fig. 104</a>)
is a valuable grass with broad, long, and succulent leaves. It spreads
by means of prostrate stolons. The spikelets have short stalks, as can
be seen on bending the ear on itself, and each spikelet contains only
one flower. The silky awns give the ear a silvery grey colour. The
grass flowers in early spring. The <b>slender foxtail</b> (<a href="#FIG_104-105">Fig. 105</a>)
is a most injurious weed of cornfields. It can be distinguished from the
meadow foxtail by its less vigorous appearance, by the thinner and more
pointed ear, and by the black patches on the ear. It is often called “black bent.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Timothy grass</b> or “meadow catstail” (<a href="#FIG_106">Fig. 106</a>)
has a general resemblance to meadow foxtail, but its ears are rough to the touch
and green in colour. It also flowers much later in the year (July) and its
pales are awnless; the two grasses are therefore easily distinguished.
Timothy grows abundantly in clay soils, forming fairly close tufts.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Yorkshire fog</b> (<a href="#FIG_107-108">Fig. 107</a>) is a rank
weed which is distasteful to cattle, partly because it is covered with
hairs and is difficult to wet, and partly because it has a bitter
flavour. It is pale in colour and soft. It spreads rapidly by means of
creeping stolons.</p>

<p><b>Oat</b> grasses are of several species; one is cultivated as a
cereal, others are valued as forage for cattle, while others still are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
troublesome weeds. The <b>wild oat</b> (<a href="#FIG_107-108">Fig. 108</a>)
is a common weed in cornfields. It is an annual, from two or three feet
high, with large spikelets forming a loose panicle, the flowers having
awns twice as long as the spikelets. The cultivated oat is supposed
to be a variety of the wild oat. The panicle of the <b>yellow oat
grass</b> is oblong, and has erect spikelets.</p>

</div>

<p>The <b>perennial rye grass</b> (<a href="#FIG_109-110">Fig. 109</a>)
is very easily recognised by its flattened ears of alternate, stalkless
spikelets. Each spikelet has only one glume. The leaves are dark-green
and glossy, and the leaf-sheaths are flattened instead of being round,
as is the case with most grasses. This is one of the most valuable of
forage grasses.</p>

<p><b>Sweet-scented vernal grass</b> (<a href="#FIG_109-110">Fig. 110</a>) does not occur very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
abundantly in meadows and pastures, but the fragrance of new-mown
hay is almost wholly attributed to it. The odour can be distinctly
perceived when a stalk of the grass is chewed. The leaves are somewhat
hairy and are broad and flat. The spikelets are borne on short stalks.
The flowers open early and are remarkable in possessing only two
stamens instead of three.</p>

<p><b>Rushes</b> and <b>sedges</b> are monocotyledonous plants which are
often erroneously called grasses. The stems of <b>rushes</b> are vivid
green, round, and pointed, and contain a distinct pith. The flowers
(<a href="#FIG_111">Fig. 111</a>) are never in spikelets; they contain six stamens, and the
pistil has three long stigmas. The <b>sedges</b>, like grasses, have
narrow, pointed leaves, but the ligules are either very small or
absent, and the leaf-sheaths are not split. The flowers are often in
spikelets with glumes, as are grass flowers. The stems of sedges are
solid and triangular.</p>

<p>The flowers of rushes in many respects resemble those of the lily
family. Indeed it is supposed that the ancestors, not only of the lily
family, but also (along a different line) of the grasses and sedges,
were primitive and now extinct rushes. The lilies have developed the
rush perianth more and more as they have increasingly depended on
insects for pollination; while in the grasses and sedges the perianth
has gradually dwindled because these plants found that wind-pollination
was sufficient for their needs.

</div>
<h4>30. THE OAK FAMILY.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The oak.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Habits of growth.</i>—Examine an oak tree
growing in an exposed situation. What is its approximate height?
Estimate the diameter of the trunk at (<i>a</i>) the ground level, (<i>b</i>)
at heights of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., feet. At what height do the principal
boughs come off? About what angle do the boughs make with the trunk?
Are they straight, evenly curved, or zig-zag? Contrast in these
respects an oak growing in a plantation. Try to account for the
differences observed.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The bark.</i>—Examine the barks in oaks of various ages. Do
the ridges and furrows caused by the splitting of the bark form any
definite pattern, or are they arranged anyhow? Find a piece which shows
the pattern well, and make a drawing of it.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Method of branching.</i>—Carefully observe the tree from a
distance, and notice how the great boughs spring from the trunk, and
in their turn give rise to smaller and smaller branches. Notice the
shape of a tuft of the smallest twigs against the sky; then close your
eyes and try to recall the picture. A still better way is to make a
careful drawing of the tree, not attempting to put in details, but
paying special attention to the trunk and main branches, and to the
general massing of the twigs. What is the general “expression” of the
tree? Would you call it, <i>e.g.</i>, graceful, formal, sturdy, delicate,
stiff, or sombre? The method of branching is best seen in the winter or
spring, when the tree is leafless.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Examine a twig in winter or spring, and notice the position of the
buds. Round the tip there may be three or more crowded buds. The one
at the tip generally dies, and those just behind grow out into lateral
branches. Can you see any trace of this having been the case with the
big boughs? On a twig make out—from the marks on the outside—the
growth of last year, two, three, and four years ago. Cut these lengths
across with a sharp knife, and count the rings of wood.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The leaves.</i>—Watch a marked twig from spring to summer,
and notice how short are the new shoots which come from the buds, and
consequently how close together the new leaves are. Does this account
for the crown of foliage on the tree being so dense? Make a drawing of
an oak leaf. At what time of the year do (i) the leaf-buds open, (ii)
the leaves fall from the tree? In winter, try to find an oak which has
not shed its leaves; is it a young tree or an old one?</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The flowers.</i>—In May notice (i) the hanging catkins, each
of which is a bunch of <i>male flowers</i> containing stamens, but no pistil;
(ii) the groups of small <i>female flowers</i> which arise in the axils of
two or three of the upper foliage leaves; each contains a pistil, but
no stamens. Notice the cup of scaly bracts, which surrounds the lower
part of a female flower. Does the tree flower before or after the leaf
buds have expanded?</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>The fruit.</i>—Trace the development of the acorn from the female
flower, and the change of the covering of scales into the woody cup. If
possible, compare for some years the yield of acorns by a selected old
oak. Germinate an acorn.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) <i>Associated animals.</i>—Make as full a list as possible of the
animals which you have seen obtaining food or shelter from the oak.
What was each doing when you saw it? Look for <i>galls</i>—the so-called
“oak apples”—and cut them open to see the insect inside. Also examine
the other kinds of galls found on the leaves and catkins.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[Make similar observations, sketches, and
notes of other forest-trees, in addition to the special observations
mentioned below, and learn to recognise their “expressions,” methods of
branching, bark, leaves, flowers, and fruit.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
2. <b>The beech.</b>—Notice the smooth, olive-grey bark, and the
“fluted column” appearance of the base of the trunk of many beeches;
the long, wavy boughs; the brown, sharp leaf-buds; the smooth,
silky-fringed leaves; the scarcity, or absence, of vegetation beneath
the tree; the hanging, globular catkins of male flowers; the pairs of
female flowers, surrounded by prickly scales. Make notes of the dates
of flowering and opening of the leaf-buds. Trees may be considered in
flower when the stamens can be seen. Trace the development of the fruit
or “mast.” Each pair of flowers gives rise to two three-sided nuts,
enclosed in a woody cup or husk. It is covered with hard bristles, and
splits into four parts when ripe.</p>

<p>Compare the <i>sweet chestnut</i>.</p>

<p>3. <b>The birch.</b>—Observe the graceful appearance of the tree; the
slender trunk, with its bark streaked with brown, yellow, and silver;
the purple-brown colour and wiriness of the young twigs; the shape
and size of the dark green leaves, and the cylindrical, many-flowered
catkins. The male catkins appear in the autumn, the smaller female
catkins in the following spring. Examine the two kinds of flowers. Find
an old birch-cone and break it open to see the winged fruits. What is
the use of the wings?</p>

<p>4. <b>The hazel and alder.</b>—In what situations do these trees
grow? Compare them with the birch. Notice that in both hazel and alder
the male flowers are in long, dangling catkins. The groups of female
flowers of the hazel look almost like leaf-buds, but can be recognised
by the spreading red stigmas. The female flowers of the alder form
distinct cones. Is the flowering part of the twig of this year’s or
last year’s growth? Look in the autumn for the cones and catkins which
will expand next spring. Trace the development of the fruit.</p>

<p><b>The oak.</b>—The student cannot better commence the study of forest
trees than by selecting one as a type, and making himself thoroughly
familiar with its life-history, and with its appearance at all times of
the year. Other trees should then be compared and contrasted point by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
point, is and with each other. The oak answers admirably as such a
central type. It is perhaps the best-known of all British forest trees,
not only from its wide distribution, but also from its historical and
legendary associations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_112" id="FIG_112"></a>
    <img src="images/i_143.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="391" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 112.</span>—The Oak.</p>
</div>

<p>The oak (<a href="#FIG_112">Fig. 112</a>) flourishes in exposed and sunny situations,
especially where the soil is well drained. It can be recognised by
the zig-zag and wide-spreading boughs, which often spring from the
trunk almost horizontally. A very strong form of trunk is plainly
necessary to support such branches, and in an old solitary oak it may
often be seen that the bole is very thick at the ground line, and then
rapidly narrows, until at a height about equal to the base-diameter it
may be only half or one-third the thickness. Above this point it is
practically cylindrical up to the origin of the boughs, where it is
swollen. An oak growing in a wood, or plantation, is of very different
form. Its trunk is tall and straight, and the larger boughs are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
given off until near the top. To secure the necessary light, the tree
used its energy in growing in length, and in keeping pace with its
neighbours rather than in spreading laterally. In such a crowded oak
the lateral buds generally remain undeveloped, while the end of the
shoot pushes onwards and upwards to the light. The opposite is the case
when there is plenty of room and light on all sides. Then it is usually
the terminal bud which dies, while the lateral buds grow out into
branches, forming the “knee-joints” which were once so greatly valued
for shipbuilding.</p>

<p>The bark of the oak is very rugged, with ridges and furrows running
almost vertically.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_113" id="FIG_113"></a>
    <img src="images/i_144.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="328" />

      <i>F</i>, cup of acorn; <i>G</i>, <i>H</i>, seed.</p>
</div>

<p>The young shoots which are formed when the buds expand in spring are
short, and the leaves are set closely together. As a result, the oak’s
foliage is characteristically dense and thick. The leaves are very
distinctive; their general shape is oval, and the margin is deeply and
irregularly lobed (<a href="#FIG_113">Fig. 113</a>).</p>

<p>If in early spring we go out in the woods and fix on an old oak tree
(the oak hardly ever flowers before it is 50 years old), we shall
probably see the <b>flowers</b> on some of the young twigs. The <i>female
flowers</i>—one to five on each flower-stalk—are near the end of the
twig, while the male flowers arise lower down. The female flowers are
destitute of stamens, each consisting practically of a single pistil,
partially enclosed in two envelopes, the lower of which ultimately
becomes the familiar “cup” of the acorn. The stigma has three spreading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
lobes for receiving pollen. The <i>male stalks</i> or catkins, hang down
from the lower part of the twig, and every stalk bears about a dozen
flowers. The male flowers have each from 5 to 12 stamens, but they have
no pistil. The stamens produce pollen in the usual way, and when they
burst, the wind blows the loose pollen from the stamens and scatters it
in the air. Some of the pollen dust is almost certain to be wafted to
the stigmas of the female flowers, and the pollen grains put out tubes,
and in due course fertilise the ovules.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_114" id="FIG_114"></a>
    <img src="images/i_145.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="411" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 114.</span>—The Beech.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Most of our forest trees resemble the oak in being pollinated by the
aid of the wind. It is evident that for the process to be successful
the trees must flower early in the spring, before the foliage has
become so thick as to be in the way of the pollen and prevent it from
reaching the stigmas of the female flowers. It is also important that
the pollen may be easily detached, and it is for this purpose that the
male flowers of the oak and similar trees hang down in the familiar
<b>catkin</b> fashion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>After fertilisation the female flower changes into an <b>acorn</b>
(<a href="#FIG_113">Fig. 113</a>, <i>E</i>), a nut enclosed in a cup.
The nut contains a single large seed, which on germination grows up
into a new oak.</p>

<p><b>Galls</b> of various kinds are to be found on most oaks. These are
excrescences caused by certain insects having laid their eggs in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
soft tissues beneath the surface. More than fifty species of insects
obtain their food from the oak. Some of these will be referred to in a
later chapter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_116" id="FIG_116"></a>
    <img src="images/i_147.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="429" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 116.</span>—The Birch.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The beech.</b>—The beech ( <a href="#FIG_114">Fig. 114</a>) is easily
recognised by the olive-grey, smooth bark, and by the shape of the base of the
trunk, which usually has the appearance of being formed by the union of
several separate columns. When well grown the tree is lofty, and bears
a wide-spreading crown of branches which, when clothed with leaves in
summer, casts a dense shade. The ground beneath the tree is generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
destitute of other vegetation. The winter-buds are long and pointed;
they expand in May, the new shoots at first drooping, but straightening
out in a fortnight or so. The leaves (<a href="#FIG_115">Fig. 115</a>)
are broad, thin, and glossy, and are fringed with fine, silky hairs.
Young beeches, like young oaks, often retain their leaves through the winter.</p>

<p>The tree is in flower by the time the foliage has fully developed. The
male flowers are borne in small, rounded catkins (<i>a</i>, <a href="#FIG_115">Fig. 115</a>).
The female flowers (3, <a href="#FIG_115">Fig. 115</a>) are in pairs.
Each pair is surrounded by prickly scales, and gives rise after
fertilisation to two three-sided and pointed nuts enclosed in a woody
cup or husk. The husk is covered with hard, blunt prickles, and when
ripe splits into four parts.</p>

<p>Beeches do not harbour many insects, but squirrels frequent them for
the sake of the nuts. The prickly husks protect the fruit from being
eaten before it is ripe.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The <b>Spanish</b>, or <b>sweet chestnut</b> is allied to the oak and
beech. It has long, narrow leaves; it flowers in July. Its fruit is
enclosed in a prickly husk, which splits into four when the nuts are
ripe in October.</p>

<p><b>The birch.</b>—The birch (<a href="#FIG_116">Fig. 116</a>) is a slender,
graceful tree, with bark streaked with brown, yellow, and silvery patches. Its leaves
(<a href="#FIG_117">Fig. 117</a>) are rather small, and their glossy, dark-green colour
contrasts pleasantly with the brownish-purple of the young twigs. Both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
male and female flowers are arranged in catkins (<a href="#FIG_117">Fig. 117</a>).
The male flowers appear in autumn, but do not open until spring, when
the newly-formed female flowers are ready. The female catkins (<i>a</i>,
<a href="#FIG_117">Fig. 117</a>) are much smaller than the male (<i>b</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>The <b>hazel</b> and <b>alder</b> develop their flowers in the year
preceding their opening. The female flowers of the hazel (<a href="#FIG_118">Fig. 118</a>)
look somewhat like buds, but may be distinguished by the red stigmas.
The fruit is a nut, enclosed by a sheath of soft bracts. The seeds
are largely dispersed by squirrels. The alder grows on the banks of
streams; its female flowers (Fig 119, <i>b</i>) are arranged in short
catkins, which may be called cones. The ripe cone (5, <a href="#FIG_119">Fig. 119</a>)
contains two nuts at the base of each scale. The fruits fall into the
stream, and float away, perhaps to germinate at a considerable distance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<h4>31. THE WILLOW AND THE POPLAR.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The willow.</b>—About the third week in March, examine
willow trees, and notice the soft, round, silky bodies which spring
alternately on the young twigs. On some trees these are broad and
yellow; they are <i>male catkins</i> (<a href="#FIG_120-121">Fig. 120</a>).
Pick off a flower and see the stamens (generally two stamens to each flower)
inserted on a small silky bract (<a href="#FIG_120-121">Fig. 121</a>, <i>B</i>).
With a lens look for the honey cup at the bottom of the bract.</p>

<p>On other trees notice the long, narrow, silvery <i>female catkins</i>. Pick
off a flower to see the single pistil with the forked style, also on
a small, honeyed bract. Have you ever seen bees visiting the flowers?
Are the catkins as conspicuous when the trees are in leaf? Is it an
advantage to the trees to flower before the leaves come out? In June,
examine the ripened female catkins. Pull out a tuft of the hairy seeds
and dry it in the sun, noticing how they form a fluffy mass. Blow the
mass of seeds. How do you think the seeds are dispersed?</p>

<p>2. <b>The poplar.</b>—Find male and female poplars and examine their
flowers. Are the female flowers pollinated by insects or by the wind?
Is self-fertilisation ever possible with willows and poplars? Why not?
Which appear first, the flowers, or the leaves of poplars? Why?</p>

<p>Examine the leaves of the English poplar. Why do they turn over so
easily, even with a very slight breeze? Are both sides of the leaf of
the same colour?</p>

<p>Compare the <i>Lombardy poplar</i> with the English poplar.</p>

<p><b>The willow.</b>—Many species of willow are known, but the sallow
willow—called the <b>saugh tree</b> in Scotland—is common in coppices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and hedges. It has purplish brown branches, and large, broad, downy
leaves. In the willow the male and female flowers are produced on
different trees, so that self-fertilisation is obviously impossible.
The flowers of the male willow form broad yellow catkins which cling
closely to the twig (<a href="#FIG_120-121">Fig. 121</a>). They are
often called “golden palms.” Each flower consists of two stamens, borne
on a silky scale which has a tiny honey cup at the base. The female
flowers form long, narrow, and silvery catkins; each flower is merely
a single pistil with a forked stigma, and, like a male flower, is
supported on a small honeyed bract. The flowers appear in March, before
the leaves, and the catkins are very conspicuous. They are visited
by bees for the sake of the honey and pollen, pollination being thus
effected. In June, the female catkins are ripe. Each ovary has now
become a fruit, which opens and liberates the silky seeds. When the
seeds dry, their fine hairs cling together so that a light fluffy mass
is formed, which can be blown to great distances by the wind.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The poplar.</b>—The various poplars are also <i>completely
unisexual</i>, that is, any one tree bears either male or female flowers,
but not both. In this case also the flowers appear before the leaves;
but the flowers are pollinated by the aid of the wind, not by insects,
and nectaries are therefore not formed. The catkins are not very much
like those of the willows in appearance, but the fruit and seeds are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
very similar. Both willows and poplars are fond of the banks of
streams. The English poplars are graceful trees which can be recognised
at a distance by the manner in which the broad leaves turn on their
long stalks, exposing the lighter-coloured under-surface at the
slightest breath of wind. This is especially noticeable with the
<b>aspen</b> or trembling poplar (<a href="#FIG_122">Fig. 122</a>).
The <b>Lombardy poplar</b> is a tall, stiff tree.</p>

<h4>32. THE ELM, LIME, AND ASH.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The elm.</b>—Notice the straight trunk, rough bark, and slender
branches of the common elm. Examine the flowers in early spring and
notice that each contains both stamens and pistil. When do the flowers
open? When do the leaves expand? Draw a leaf and a fruit. What is the
use of the broad plate of the fruit?</p>

<p>2. <b>The lime.</b>—Observe the straight trunk, smooth bark, and
general <i>pyramid</i> shape of the tree. Draw a leaf, and notice that it
is pointed and is larger on one side of the midrib than on the other.
Notice that the flower stalks spring from leaves (bracts) differing in
shape (<a href="#FIG_126">Fig. 126</a>) and colour from ordinary leaves. Draw one of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
leaves with its attached flower stalk. When do the flowers open? Try to
discover whether bees haunt the flowers. Find out what is the use to
the fruit of the long leafy bract.</p>

<p>3. <b>The ash.</b>—Look in winter for the black buds and the flattened
tips of the twigs. When do the flowers open? Notice their rich purple
colour. Examine a flower and make out the two stamens and the pistil.
Trace the formation of the fruit, which is winged and hangs in bunches
called <i>keys</i>. What is the use of the wing? When do the leaves expand?
Are they simple or compound? Draw one. What is its colour? When do the
leaves fall?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
<b>The elm.</b>—The elm (<a href="#FIG_123">Fig. 123</a>) is usually a lofty
tree, easily recognised at a distance by its straight trunk, slender branches,
and rounded masses of foliage. The bark is rough and very corky. The
tree flowers early in the spring before the leaves are expanded. The
flowers are purple and contain both stamens and pistil. Each fruit
(<a href="#FIG_124">Fig. 124</a>) is a flat plate with a rounded seed box
in the middle; it is distributed by the wind. The seeds of the
common elm do not often ripen in this country. The leaves (<a href="#FIG_124">Fig. 124</a>)
are rough to the touch, and have very prominent veins. They do not fall until late autumn.</p>

<p><b>The lime.</b>—The lime tree (<a href="#FIG_125">Fig. 125</a>) has a straight
smooth trunk. The tree generally spreads at the base, and tapers to a blunt apex.
The leaves are bright green, heart-shaped, and pointed, and plainly
larger on one side of the midrib than on the other. The yellowish-green
flowers are in bunches, carried on a stalk which springs from
the middle of a long, narrow bract (<a href="#FIG_126">Fig. 126</a>).
The flowers are complete—calyx, corolla, stamens, and pistil being all
present—and are pollinated by bees, which visit them for the sake of
nectar, being attracted by the sweet scent.

      <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 127.</span>—The Ash.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The ash</b> (<a href="#FIG_127">Fig. 127</a>) is a very graceful tree,
and its compound leaves, with leaflets springing from the sides of the midrib,
give the foliage a characteristically feathery appearance. The bark is
ashen-grey in colour. The tips of the twigs are curiously flattened,
and the winter buds are jet black. The flowers are small, with two
purple-black stamens and a pistil. They open in April before the leaves
appear, forming close clusters. The fruits are long and flat, and hang
together in bunches which are popularly called <b>keys</b>. They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
only detached by high winds, and are then blown to considerable
distances. The leaves appear rather late—about the end of May—and
are shed early. They are compound, each consisting of seven or more
leaflets arranged in opposite pairs along the midrib, with a single
leaflet at the end.</p>

<p>The <b>mountain ash</b> or Rowan tree has leaves somewhat like those
of the ash proper, but in other respects it is quite different, as it
belongs to the rose family (<a href="#Page_103">p. 103</a>).</p>

<h4>33. THE SYCAMORE AND HORSE CHESTNUT.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The sycamore.</b>—Observe the size and general shape of the
tree. Examine the twigs in winter and watch the buds open in spring.
Draw a leaf. Why are the leaves usually so sticky in warm weather?
Notice the hanging sprays of green flowers. Are both stamens and pistil
present in the same flower? Are the flowers visited by bees? Why?
Follow the development of the fruit. Draw a pair of fruits. What is the
use of the wing on a fruit? Do the fruits fall off themselves or are
they torn off by gales? Look for seedling sycamores in the woods; also
germinate seeds in garden soil and again observe the various stages.</p>

<p>Compare the <i>plane</i>, and notice the pyramidal shape of the tree. The
leaves are very similar in outline to those of the sycamore, but the
flowers are clustered into balls which dangle on long stalks. In
summer, pull off a leaf and observe how the axillary bud is covered by
the cup-shaped base of the leaf-stalk.</p>

<p>2. <b>The horse chestnut.</b>—Notice the general shape and method of
branching. These characters, the large buds in winter, and the shape
and size of the leaves in spring and summer, render the tree easily
recognisable at all seasons. Trace the connection between the method
of branching and arrangement of the leaves and buds on the twigs. Note
the date of flowering, and of the unfolding and shedding of the leaves.
Examine the flowers; are they pollinated by insects or by the wind?
Trace the development of the fruit.

      <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 128.</span>—The Sycamore.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The sycamore</b> (<a href="#FIG_128">Fig. 128</a>) is one of the best-known trees in this
country, and often grows to a great height. Its leaves (<a href="#FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>) are
large and five-pointed, the main veins spreading from the top of the
leaf stalk. When young they are of a beautiful red colour. In hot
weather the leaves become very sticky with a sugary syrup called
<b>honey-dew</b>. The sycamore is indeed a species of maple, and is
closely related to the sugar maple of North America. In May, the
flowers hang from the twigs in drooping green clusters. They contain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
both stamens and pistils, and are visited by bees for the sake of
the honey in which they abound. The fruits or <b>keys</b>
(Figs. <a href="#FIG_137"> 137</a> and <a href="#FIG_4"> 4</a>)
occur in pairs, or sometimes three together. Each has a flat,
membranous wing, by means of which it is easily transported by the wind.</p>

<p>In Scotland the sycamore is often called the <b>plane</b>. The leaves
of the plane and sycamore are somewhat similar in shape, but the trees
belong to different families. The plane can be identified by its
globular heads of flowers and subsequent balls of seeds, which hang on
long stalks from the twigs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_129" id="FIG_129"></a>
    <img src="images/i_159.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="419" />
      <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 129.</span>—The Horse Chestnut.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The horse chestnut.</b>—The horse chestnut differs from all our
other forest trees of equal size in bearing brilliantly coloured and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
conspicuous flowers. The flowers are complete, containing not only
stamens and pistil, but also a calyx and a beautiful pink or white
corolla. The tree has a striking appearance at all seasons of the year.
In winter, the thick twigs, the large terminal buds, and the opposite
lateral buds already described on <a href="#Page_62">pp. 62-64</a> are very conspicuous,
and give an instructive clue to the method of branching. The buds
open early and the new shoots rapidly lengthen, so that the tree is
a mass of foliage whilst most neighbouring trees are still bare. The
leaves (<a href="#FIG_25-26">Fig. 26</a>) are compound, consisting of seven large,
spoon-shaped leaflets which spring from a common point at the end of the leaf-stalk.
The flowers open in May. The fruit is ripe in October and then falls to
the ground, its prickly husk splitting into three parts to liberate the
rounded seeds. The leaves fall early, leaving large scars (<a href="#FIG_37-38">Fig. 38</a>),
which have some resemblance to the hoof-marks of a horse.</p>

<h4>34. CONE-BEARING TREES.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The Scotch pine.</b>—Notice the shape of the tree: the tall
straight stem and rugged bark, and the dark tufts of foliage. Does the
tree bear leaves all the year round? Does it ever shed its leaves?
Are they shed at any special time of the year? Examine a leafy twig;
observe that the leaves are needle-shaped and come off in pairs. At the
apex is a terminal bud which will continue the length of the twig next
season; the lateral buds below will grow out into twigs at the same
time. Try to make out which parts of the twig grew during last year,
and which during the two previous years.</p>

<p>Notice the cones. The young female cones (<i>b</i>, <a href="#FIG_130">Fig. 130</a>, 1)
are erect, and their scales separate slightly in spring to allow the pollen to
enter. Afterwards they hang down (<i>c</i>) whilst the seeds are ripening.
Three years after pollination the scales come apart again to let the
seeds fall out. Examine the seeds from a ripe cone and notice the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
attached wings (<a href="#FIG_130">Fig. 130</a>, 4). Examine cones of various ages. In spring
look for the pointed cones of male flowers (<a href="#FIG_130">Fig. 130</a>, 1, <i>a</i>)
which produce the abundant pollen.</p>

<p>2. <b>The spruce fir.</b>—Compare the spruce fir. Notice the conical
<i>Christmas tree</i> shape and the large spreading branches near the
ground. Compare the leaves and cones with those of the pine.</p>

<p>3. <b>The larch.</b>—Compare the larch with the pine and spruce.
Notice the drooping boughs, the alternate tufts of leaves, and the
small cones arranged in a row along the twig. Is the larch an evergreen?</p>

<p><b>Cone-bearing trees.</b>—The cone-bearing trees, such as the pines
and firs, are true flowering plants, but of a type which is very
different from any hitherto described. The flowers are peculiar, and
form cones, the male flowers producing pollen and the female flowers
ovules. The ovules, however, are not enclosed in ovaries, but are
naked, so that the pollen gains access to the ovule directly, and
is not received on a stigma. The female cone consists very largely
of smooth scales, a pair of ovules being borne by each scale near
its base. The pollen grains of these trees are rendered particularly
buoyant by being blown out at the sides into little air-filled
bladders, and are thus easily carried by the wind. When the pollen
falls on the female cone, the grains slide down the smooth scales and
very likely come in contact with the ovules at the bottom. Each ovule
has a sticky drop of gum at its end, and the pollen is caught in the
gum. Such pollen grains as roll off the upper scales are almost certain
to fall on a lower one and reach the ovules.</p>

<p><b>The Scotch pine.</b>—This is a large tree, with a dome-shaped crown
of foliage. The bark is rough and scaly. Its foliage leaves (<a href="#FIG_130">Fig. 130</a>)
are long and needle-shaped, and occur in pairs, each pair being carried
by a very short branch. The leaves do not fall off each winter, as do
those of most forest trees, but remain on the branches for three years
or more, so that the younger twigs are clothed with foliage at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
seasons. The cones of male flowers (<a href="#FIG_130">Fig. 130</a>, 1, <i>a</i>) are found at
the base of some of the shoots of the current year. The female cones
(<a href="#FIG_130">Fig. 130</a>, 1, <i>b</i>) are formed round the <i>ends</i> of the young twigs.
They consist mainly of overlapping woody scales, each being knobbed
on its exposed surface and bearing a couple of ovules near the base,
where it springs from the axis of the cone. The young cones are erect,
and in spring (when clouds of pollen are blowing about) their scales
separate slightly to admit the pollen in the chinks between them. After
pollination the scales close again and the cone hangs down (<a href="#FIG_130">Fig. 130</a>,
1, <i>c</i>). The ovules receive the pollen in May, but the actual union, or
fertilisation, does not take place until June of the following year.
The seeds become mature two years after fertilisation. When they are
ripe each bears a thin wing which has split off from the upper surface
of the scale. The scales now separate, and the winged seeds fall out,
to be distributed by the wind. When all the seeds have fallen, the
empty cones drop off the tree.</p>

</div>

<p>Owing to the length of time necessary for the ripening of the seeds,
cones of various ages may be found on the tree all the year round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
<b>The spruce fir.</b>—The spruce has a characteristic conical shape,
which is familiar in Christmas trees. The branches are long, and spread
horizontally. The foliage leaves are needle-shaped and four-sided in
section, but are shorter than those of the pine, and are borne singly.
The tree is “evergreen” in the sense that the pine is so, that is, the
leaves are not shed all together, but gradually.</p>

<p>The method of pollination, fertilisation, and distribution of the
winged seeds is similar to that of the pine. In the spruce, however,
the seeds are ripe in October of the year in which the cones are
pollinated.</p>

<p><b>The larch.</b>—The larch is a cone-bearer, and a near relative
of the pines and firs, but it differs from them in shedding its
leaves annually. The leaves are (as is usual in cone-bearing trees)
needle-shaped, but they are very thin and they grow in tufts on short
alternate spurs. The cones are small and are arranged in a row on the
twig. Their scales do not fit so closely together as those of the pine
and fir cones. The larch tree has a conical form, but can readily be
distinguished from the spruce by its <i>drooping</i> boughs, and absence
of leaves in winter.</p>

<p><b>Gymnosperms.</b>—The pines, firs, and larches are neither
dicotyledons nor monocotyledons, but belong to a class of plants which
botanists call <b>gymnosperms</b>, in allusion to the fact that their
ovules are not enclosed in ovaries, like those of other flowering
plants, but are <i>naked</i>. This is the most ancient and primitive
group of flowering plants known. In fact they form a connecting link
between higher flowering plants and the group to which the ferns and
horsetails—which are still more primitive—belong.

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class="h_subtitle">FRUITS: HOW SEEDS ARE SCATTERED.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>35. PLANTS WHICH SOW THEIR OWN SEEDS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The fruit of the wallflower.</b>—Examine wallflower fruits and
make out that each consists of the ripened pistil. Does the fruit open
of itself? How many chambers does it consist of? Where are the seeds
attached? Are they blown off at last by the wind? Draw the fruit. It is
called a <i>siliqua</i>.</p>

<p>2. Compare with this the fruit of <i>shepherd’s purse</i> (<a href="#FIG_62-64">Fig. 62</a>),
and <i>penny cress</i> (<a href="#FIG_131-132">Fig. 132</a>), and notice
that they are of the type of the wallflower fruit, but are much broader
in proportion to the length. Such a fruit is called a <i>silicula</i>. Draw.</p>

<p>3. <b>The fruit of the pea.</b>—Examine a ripe pea-pod and compare it
with (<i>a</i>) the pistil of an unfertilised flower, (<i>b</i>) a half-ripe
pod. How many carpels have taken part in forming the pod? How many seeds
(peas) does the pod contain? Leave a pod on the plant until the shell
becomes dry, to find out how the fruit opens. Does it open along one
edge only, or along both? How are the seeds attached? Such a pod is
called a <i>legume</i>. Draw it.</p>

<p>Compare and draw the legumes of the <i>broad bean</i>, <i>French bean</i>,
<i>scarlet runner</i>, <i>laburnum</i> (remember its seeds are poisonous), and
<i>bird’s foot trefoil</i>. The legume of the bird’s foot trefoil bursts
open suddenly and scatters the seeds in the air. Is the scattering of
the seeds any advantage? Why?</p>

<p>4. <b>The fruit of the field geranium.</b>—Make out that five carpels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
are grouped around a central rod. Examine fruits which have opened.
About noon on a bright, sunny day gently touch a ripe fruit with a
small brush, and watch the carpels spring back from the rod and jerk
the seeds into the air. Compare and contrast this fruit with a siliqua,
silicula, and legume respectively.</p>

<p>5. <b>The fruit of the poppy.</b>—Examine a poppy head. The top of the
fruit is the stigma. Observe below this a line of small holes running
round the fruit. Draw. Shake the fruit, and notice that seeds fall out
through the holes. Cut the fruit across to see the large number of
small seeds inside. How does the fruit hang on the growing plant? Does
the wind shake it and liberate the seeds?</p>

<p>6. <b>The fruit of the pansy and violet.</b>—Watch the ripening of
the fruits on the plants. Observe that the ovary swells up into an
egg-shaped body which afterwards splits into three boat-shaped valves
containing seeds. Try to make out why the seeds are one by one shot out
as the sides of the valves dry. Put a ripe fruit before the fire and
watch the process. Imitate it by placing a pea between two flat rulers
and pressing the rulers together.</p>

<p><b>The origin of a fruit.</b>—When the ovules of a flower have
been fertilised (<a href="#Page_92">p. 92</a>) by the pollen tubes they change
into seeds which have the remarkable power of growing up—in favourable
circumstances—into plants resembling that which produced the seeds.
This is not, however, the only result of fertilisation. Whilst the
ovules are changing into ripe seeds, those parts of the flower—the
stamens, corolla, and calyx—which have finished their work wither and
fall off, though the calyx sometimes remains. Other parts—the pistil
and sometimes the receptacle (<a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>)—take on new duties,
and become gradually modified in order to protect or scatter the seeds.</p>

<p>Thus, the tender wall of the pistil often becomes a woody, leathery, or
juicy seed-case; while the receptacle, or top of the flower stalk, may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
become fleshy and swollen with sugary pulp, as a bait for birds and
other animals. In any case we give the name of fruit to all such
altered and persistent parts together with the seeds which accompany
them. A pea pod, for example, is as truly a fruit as a plum, and a
poppy-head as a strawberry.</p>

<p>What a fruit is like depends to a great extent upon the characters of
the pistil which gave rise to it. If, for example, the pistil consists
of several separate carpels, the ripened carpels or fruits will also
be separate. When, on the other hand, the pistil is composed of united
carpels, these will remain united, at least until the fruit is ripe.
Then in some cases they come apart.</p>

</div>

<p>The part of a fruit which is derived from the walls of the pistil is
called the <b>pericarp</b>.</p>

<p><b>The fruit of the wallflower.</b>—After fertilisation the stamens,
petals, and sepals of the wallflower drop off, leaving the pistil alone
on the top of the flower stalk. The pistil increases greatly in size
(<a href="#FIG_131-132">Fig. 131</a>, <i>B</i>) during the ripening of the
seeds. At last its wall (the pericarp) splits into two flaps. These
become free at the bottom, exposing a central plate which bears the
rows of seeds. When the seeds are quite ripe, a slight breeze is
sufficient to shake them off, and they fall to the ground to take their
chance of finding a place favourable for germination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
A fruit with a dry pericarp, which opens of itself when the seeds are
ripe, is called a <b>capsule</b>. This particular kind of
capsule—consisting of two carpels which come apart at maturity, leaving
a central partition bearing seeds—is known as a <b>siliqua</b>.
When it is short in proportion to its length, as in the shepherd’s
purse (<a href="#FIG_62-64">Fig. 62</a>) and penny cress (<a href="#FIG_131-132">Fig. 132</a>),
it is distinguished as a <b>silicula</b>.</p>

<p><b>The fruits of the pea tribe.</b>—The pod of the pea (<a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>)
and its relatives is a capsule of another kind. It consists of one carpel
only, and opens, when ripe, along both back and front margins to
liberate the seeds. Such a fruit is called a <b>legume</b>. In the
young fruit the pericarp is somewhat fleshy and succulent, but it
becomes dry during ripening. The legume of the bird’s foot trefoil
bursts open suddenly, and throws the seeds to a considerable distance.</p>

<p><b>The fruit of the field geranium</b> (<a href="#FIG_133">Fig. 133</a>)
is a long capsule composed of five carpels arranged round a central
column (<i>A</i>). When the seeds are ripe, the carpels suddenly spring
from the rod, remaining attached only at their upper ends (<i>B</i>), and
fling the seeds into the air. The method may be watched by stroking the
fruits very gently with a small brush, when they open in the manner
described. The experiment is most likely to succeed in dry, sunny
weather, about the middle of the day.</p>

<p><b>The fruit of the poppy.</b>—The pistil of the poppy swells during
ripening into a large, globular capsule known as the poppy head. The
top of the fruit (<a href="#FIG_134">Fig. 134</a>) is the persistent stigma.
Just below this, a line of small holes like windows runs round the head. As the fruit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
hangs inverted on the top of the flower stalk it is shaken about by the
wind, and the tiny seeds fall out through the windows.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The fruit of the violet or pansy.</b>—The arrangement by which the
violet (<a href="#FIG_134">Fig. 134</a>) or pansy sows its seeds is most interesting.
After fertilisation the ovary swells into a great egg-shaped capsule, in the
inside of which the seeds are arranged in three rows. When the seeds
have become ripe and hard, the capsule splits down the side along three
lines, and is thus divided into three parts. These open outwards, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
bend back as shown in <a href="#FIG_135">Fig. 135</a>. Each is a boat-shaped valve.
The seeds inside are thus exposed to the air, and they soon dry and become ready
for scattering.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

               seeds being shot out of fruit.</p>
</div>

<p>Then the curved sides of each valve begin to straighten and come
together, and naturally allow less and less room for the hard, smooth
seeds inside. The pressure of the sides of each valve on the seeds
inside it becomes greater and greater, until one by one they are shot
out to a considerable distance. If a ripe violet ovary be warmed before
the fire the whole operation may easily be watched. The process may
be imitated by putting a pea between two flat rulers and pressing the

<p><b>Why fruits are scattered.</b>—A flowering plant is practically
confined for life to the place where it first sprang up, so that it is
unable to go about and select favourable situations for its offspring.
On the other hand, if the seeds simply fell to the ground beneath the
parent plant, the seedlings would generally be so crowded together that
they would interfere very much with each other’s growth. In addition,
they would often be under a great disadvantage, because the parent
plant would keep so much light from them. Hence, very many plants have
some special arrangement for scattering their seeds, so that some at
least of the seeds will have a chance of falling in a place where they
will obtain plenty of light, air, and good soil.

<p>In this section we have studied examples of devices by which plants sow
their own seeds. We shall see next that other plants call in the help
of the wind and of animals.</p>

<h4>36. SEEDS SOWN BY THE WIND.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The fruit of the dandelion.</b>—Examine the manner in which the
tiny flowers of the dandelion are grouped together to form the head
(<a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>); and make out the various parts of the flower, especially
the <i>ovary</i>—a little white knob at the bottom of the flower, and the
<i>calyx-tube</i>—forming a tuft of fine hairs above the ovary. Trace the
development of the fruits: the withering of the corollas and stamens,
the elongation of the calyx-tube, and the expansion of the tuft of
hairs to form a parachute. Blow a dandelion “clock” (the head of
fruits), and notice how the parachutes float the fruits in the air.</p>

<p>Examine “thistle down” and contrast it with the dandelion fruit.</p>

<p>2. <b>The fruit of the willow.</b>—Examine the ripened catkins of a
female willow in June, and notice how each fruit has split into halves,
which come apart and expose the silky seeds inside. Pull a tuft of
seeds out and dry them in the sun. Notice that they wriggle and writhe
about and gradually become entangled together into a woolly mass, which
is easily blown away.</p>

<p>3. <b>The elm fruit.</b>—About the end of April look for elm fruits.
Notice the flat green plate (wing) with the rounded swelling near the
middle (<a href="#FIG_124">Fig. 124</a>, 5). Cut open the fruit and see
that the swelling is caused by a single seed. How does the flat wing
aid in the distribution of the seed?</p>

<p>Compare the winged fruits of the <i>ash</i> and <i>sycamore</i>
(<a href="#FIG_137">Fig. 137</a>).</p>

<p>Do these winged fruits drop from the trees easily, or are they torn off
by gales?</p>

<p>Take a pair of sycamore fruits. Cut off the wing from one and let it
and an uninjured fruit fall at the same instant from a height. Which
reaches the ground first? Why?</p>

<p>4. <b>Pine and fir cones.</b>—Examine and compare pine and fir cones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of various ages. Break open a ripe cone and see the scales with the
pairs of naked seeds, each seed bearing a thin, papery wing which has
split off from the upper surface of the scale.</p>

<div class="figleft">

          of Dandelion<br />Fruits. (×&nbsp;¼.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Wind-sown seeds.</b>—Many plants depend on the wind for the
dispersal of their seeds, and consequently the seeds are provided with
outgrowths of various kinds, which increase the surface greatly without
adding much to the weight, and, acting like parachutes, offer increased
resistance to the air and thus prevent the seeds from falling quickly
to the ground. In some cases the outgrowth is part of the pericarp, in
others it is an appendix carried by the seed itself, while in the lime
it is the bract upon which the flowers were formerly borne.</p>

<p><b>The dandelion fruit.</b>—The fruit of the dandelion (<a href="#FIG_136">Fig. 136</a>)
affords one of the best possible examples of wind-dispersal. It will
be remembered (<a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>) that what is commonly called the
flower of the dandelion is really a head of perhaps 300 complete flowers: each with
a hairy calyx-tube, a yellow, strap-shaped corolla, five stamens, and
a pistil. When the flowers have been fertilised, the yellow corollas
and the stamens wither, the ovary increases in size with the ripening
of the single nutlet in its interior, and each calyx-tube elongates
until it is about an inch in length, the tuft of fine hairs being still
at its upper end. The attachment of the fruit (<a href="#FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>, 4)
to the disc (receptacle) is so slight when the seed is ripe that a very gentle
puff of air is sufficient to overcome it. The tuft of hairs at the upper
end has by this time expanded until it acts like a parachute, which
supports the tiny fruit for a long time in the air.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>The common <b>thistle</b>—a relative of the dandelion—also
distributes its fruit by means of a tuft of fine hairs derived from
the calyx. In this case the hairs radiate from the seed. Such “thistle
down” is commonly found floating through the air in summer.</p>

<div class="figright">
    <a name="FIG_137" id="FIG_137"></a>
    <img src="images/i_173.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="146" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 137.</span>—A pair of<br />
          Sycamore Fruits. (×&nbsp;⅔.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>The willow fruit.</b>—The catkins of the female willow are ripe in
June. Each catkin consists of a large number of tiny pods derived from
the ovaries of the flowers (<a href="#Page_151">p. 151</a>). Each fruit splits into halves,
which bend back from each other (<a href="#FIG_120-121">Fig. 121</a>, <i>F</i>),
exposing the silky seeds within to the warmth of the sun. The seeds
(<i>H</i>) turn and twist about as they dry, and gradually entangle
themselves together into a light, woolly mass, which is easily blown to
great distances by the wind. The willow and the dandelion, therefore,
use very similar devices to ensure the dispersal of their seeds,
although these plants are not at all nearly related.</p>

<p><b>The fruits of the elm, sycamore, and ash.</b>—These common forest
trees bear fruits with the seed attached to a flat plate, which is an
outgrowth of the pericarp (<a href="#Page_167">p. 167</a>). In the elm fruit (<a href="#FIG_124">Fig. 124</a>, 5)
the plate is green and oval, and the seed forms a rounded swelling at, or
near, its middle. The fruits of the <b>sycamore</b> generally grow in
pairs (Figs. <a href="#FIG_33">33</a> and <a href="#FIG_137">137</a>).
Each half consists of a single seed with an attached membranous plate,
and the two seed-boxes of each pair are in contact. The fruits of the
<b>ash</b> hang from the twigs in bunches called “keys,” each fruit
on a separate little stalk. The plates which bear the seed are long,
narrow, and oval in shape.</p>

<p>It is plain that such plates, or wings, expose a relatively large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
surface to the air and prevent the fruit from falling to the ground as
quickly as it otherwise would. The fruit is thus often blown to a great
distance before it finally settles and the seed germinates. The action
of the wing may be well shown by cutting off the plate from a sycamore
fruit and letting it and one with an attached wing fall at the same
instant from a height. The seed without a wing comes straight down as a
pea would; but the winged seed spins in the air and settles more slowly.</p>

<p>In the case of the round downy fruits of the <b>lime</b>, a similar
service is performed by the bract (<a href="#FIG_126">Fig. 126</a>),
upon which the flowers were carried.</p>

<p><b>Pine and fir cones.</b>—If a ripe pine, or fir cone is broken open,
it will be seen that each seed is attached to a thin, papery wing
(<a href="#FIG_130">Fig. 130</a>, 4), which has split off the upper
surface of the scale bearing the seeds. The winged seeds are shaken out
of the cone by the wind, and blown away.</p>

<p><b>Trees alone bear winged seeds.</b>—Winged seeds would be useless to
any but fairly high trees, because if they were formed on the low plant
they would fall to the ground long before the wind could catch them
properly. It is also interesting to find that such seeds are generally
attached so firmly that they are only broken off by gales strong enough
to carry them a considerable distance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the tiny plumed fruit of the dandelion or thistle is
so very light in comparison with the surface exposed to the air that it
takes quite a long time to fall even a few inches.</p>

<h4>37. SEEDS WHICH ARE SCATTERED BY ANIMALS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Hooked fruits.</b>—Examine plants of <i>herb bennet</i> (wood avens)
in summer and autumn, and find the fruits. Brush your sleeve against
the fruits, and notice how they cling to the cloth. Examine them with a
lens and observe the hooks at the ends of the styles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Compare <i>goosegrass</i> (cleavers) and find the hooks on the fruits.</p>

<p>2. <b>Nuts.</b>—Examine a <i>hazel</i> nut. Notice the sheathing bracts at
the base of the fruit. Crack the nut and examine the broken edge of the
shell (pericarp) with a lens. Make out the three layers which compose
it. How many seeds are present? Cut the seed (kernel) across and see
that the bulk of it consists of two cotyledons (<a href="#Page_1">Chap. I.</a>).
Does the fruit open of itself, if undisturbed?</p>

<p>Compare the acorn of the <i>oak</i>. Trace the development of the acorn from
the female flower, noticing that the cup is developed from a wrinkled
disc surrounding the lower part of the flower. Cut across the ovary
in June and notice that there are six ovules in it. In the ripe fruit
observe that the cup separates easily from the nut. Remove the shell
(pericarp) of the nut. How many seeds does it contain? What do you
think has become of the other five ovules? Cut through the seed and
observe the two cotyledons.</p>

<p>Compare the fruits of the <i>beech</i>. Notice that they are three-sided
nuts (each being a seed enclosed in a woody pericarp); and that two
nuts occur together, surrounded by a bristly woody cup which splits,
when the nuts are ripe, into four valves.</p>

<p>3. <b>Stone fruits.</b>—Examine a ripe <i>plum</i>. Cut it open and crack
the stone to see the single seed. Notice that the pericarp consists of
three layers as in the hazel nut, but that here the middle layer is
soft and fleshy, and the outer layer is the “skin.” The stone is the
inner layer of the pericarp. Is there any special means of liberating
the seed? Compare the <i>cherry</i>, and examine the seed and the three
layers of the pericarp.</p>

<p>Examine the fruits of the <i>blackberry</i> and <i>raspberry</i>, and observe
that each consists of several small stone-fruits arranged on the
receptacle.</p>

<p>4. <b>Berries.</b>—<i>The gooseberry.</i>—Notice the stalk at the bottom
of the fruit, and, at the top, the withered remains of the calyx. Cut
across a half-ripe gooseberry and observe the thick, fleshy pericarp
enclosing the seeds. Treat a ripe gooseberry in the same way, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
observe that the pericarp has now for the most part become a soft
pulp, in which the seeds are embedded. The rest of the pericarp is a
membranous skin. Is there any special means of liberating the seeds?</p>

<p>Compare <i>grapes</i>, <i>currants</i>, <i>oranges</i>, and <i>vegetable marrow</i> fruits,
and notice that the structure of these resembles that of the gooseberry.</p>

<p>5. <b>The apple.</b>—Cut across the receptacle of the flower (apple
blossom) and notice how the five carpels are buried in it (<a href="#Page_106">p. 106</a>).
Trace the formation of the fruit, and see how the <i>receptacle</i> becomes
larger and larger during ripening. At the top of the ripe fruit observe
the withered remains of the calyx. Cut the apple through across the
middle to see the <i>core</i>. This consists of the horny walls of the five
carpels and the contained seeds (pips). From what part of the flower is
the fleshy, eatable part of the apple derived? Compare the <i>pear</i>.</p>

<p>6. <b>The rose hip.</b>—Examine fruits of the wild rose. Notice that
they are urn-shaped. On the flat rim of the urn observe the five scars
left by the sepals (or, in some cases, the sepals themselves). In the
opening of the urn see a tuft of greyish hairs. Cut the fruit down from
top to bottom through the middle to see the thick, fleshy wall of the
urn and the contained <i>nutlets</i>. From what part of the flower is the
fleshy wall of the hip derived? Examine a nutlet. What does the tuft
of hairs seen in the mouth of the urn consist of? Open a nutlet with a
needle and pick out the seed.</p>

<p>7. <b>The strawberry.</b>—Cut a strawberry down the middle and notice
at the base the persistent calyx, in the inside the fleshy receptacle,
and on the outside the yellowish nutlets. Open a nutlet with a needle
and pick out the seed.</p>

<p><b>The help of animals.</b>—It has been seen in <a href="#Page_55">Chapter VI.</a> that
insects play a very important part in the fertilisation of many
flowers. Very many plants also call in the aid of animals at a later
stage for the dispersal of the seeds, and the devices by which this aid
is obtained are often very ingenious.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Hooked fruits.</b>—Sometimes after a country walk the reader has
probably found small fruits and seeds sticking to his clothes. They
have become attached to the cloth by means of small hooks which they
carry. The fruit of the <b>herb bennet</b> (wood avens) is a good
example of this device. When the stigma of the fruit breaks away, a
little hook is left at the top of the style (<a href="#FIG_138">Fig. 138</a>).
Goosegrass or cleavers—a common hedgerow plant—and many others have also hooked
fruits. Sheep or cattle, grazing near such plants are very likely to
brush against them and carry off the fruits and seeds in their hair.
They may not again reach the ground until they have been carried far
from the place where they grew.</p>

<p><b>The position of hooked fruits.</b>—It is evident that these little
hooks would be quite useless if the fruits grew out of the reach of
animals. Such hooked fruits are never found, for instance, on high trees.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><b>Nuts.</b>—A fruit which has a dry, woody pericarp and does not open
of itself is called a <b>nut</b>. The fruits of the hazel, oak, and
beech are good examples. The shell (pericarp) of the <b>hazel</b> nut
(<a href="#FIG_139">Fig. 139</a>) is composed of three layers, and encloses a single seed, or
kernel. The nut of the <b>oak</b> (<a href="#FIG_113">Fig. 113</a>) is called an acorn. Its
lower part lies in a cup developed from a wrinkled disc by which the
lower part of the female flower was surrounded. When the fruit is ripe
the nut easily separates from the cup. The acorn contains one seed
only, which consists largely of two swollen cotyledons. If the ovary of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the female flower of the oak is cut across in June six ovules are found
in it. As in the case of the hazel only one ovule is allowed to reach
maturity; the rest are sacrificed in order that the remaining one may
be more perfectly developed. In the <b>beech</b>, two three-sided nuts
occur together, surrounded by a bristly, woody cup, which splits into
four valves when the nuts are ripe.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

           longitudinal section of fruit.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The dispersal of nuts.</b>—<b>Squirrels</b> and other nut-eating
animals are instrumental in the dispersal of the seeds in a somewhat
indirect manner. They have a habit of storing up nuts and seeds in
holes; but in their active life these animals often forget where their
larder is. The seeds, thus left to themselves, sprout and grow into
trees. The unripe nuts of the beech are protected from the attacks of
squirrels by the hard bristles on the outer husk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
<b>Stone fruits.</b>—A ripe <b>plum</b> (<a href="#FIG_140">Fig. 140</a>) or <b>cherry</b>
(<a href="#FIG_77">Fig. 77</a>), like a nut, consists of a seed and a pericarp; but here the
pericarp is specially modified to tempt animals and at the same time to
protect the seed from them. The inner pericarp-layer is a hard, woody
shell called the stone; the middle part swells up to form a juicy,
sweet mass; while the outer layer constitutes the “skin,” and is often
beautifully coloured.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Blackberries</b> (<a href="#FIG_141">Fig. 141</a> F) and
<b>raspberries</b> consist of several small fruits of the plum type,
which are arranged round an axis derived from the receptacle of the flower.</p>

<p><b>Berries.</b>—The <b>gooseberry</b> (<a href="#FIG_142">Fig. 142</a>)
is a type of this class of fruit. It contains several seeds. The
pericarp is thick and fleshy before the fruit is ripe, but during
ripening the greater part of it becomes a soft, sweet pulp in which
the seeds are embedded. The rest of the pericarp is a membranous skin.
<b>Grapes</b>, <b>currants</b>, <b>oranges</b>, and <b>vegetable
marrow</b> fruits are also berries. The vegetable marrow has obviously
a general resemblance to a half-ripe gooseberry but is on a much larger scale.</p>

<p><b>The apple.</b>—In the apple (<a href="#FIG_143">Fig. 143</a>) we have an example of a
fruit in the formation of which the receptacle has taken a large share.
Even in the flower, the five carpels of the pistil are buried in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
receptacle, and as the seeds (pips) ripen, the <b>receptacle</b> swells
until it composes the greater part of the fruit and at last becomes
sweet and fleshy. The carpels with the contained seeds constitute the
<b>core</b>. The withered sepals are still to be seen at the top of the
fruit. The structure of the <b>pear</b> is quite similar to that of the apple.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The fruit of the wild rose.</b>—The fruits of the wild rose are
called <b>hips</b>. They are urn-shaped, and on the flat rim of the urn
five scars show the former position of the sepals.</p>

<p>In some cases the sepals themselves have remained. The narrower mouth
of the urn is filled by a tuft of greyish hairs which, when the fruit
is cut open, are seen to be the styles of the carpels. The carpels are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
hairy, and stand on the bottom and sides of the urn-cavity. Each carpel
contains a seed. Comparison with the flower shows that the red, fleshy
urn is the developed <b>receptacle</b>.</p>

<p><b>The strawberry.</b>—In the strawberry (<a href="#FIG_144">Fig. 144</a>)
the eatable part of the fruit is again the swollen and juicy
receptacle. In this case it has grown up on the <i>inside</i> of the
carpels—the little, yellow nutlets (carpels) lying on the surface. Each
carpel contains a seed.</p>

<p><b>Why some fruits are sweet.</b>—The delicious flavours of sweet
fruits have been developed as baits for the allurement of such animals
as are likely to scatter the seeds to the best advantage. Consider
such fruits as cherries, currants, and rose-hips. Birds—such as
thrushes—find them very nice to eat, and are ready to carry them away
to consume at their leisure. The birds eat the sweet, fleshy part, but
in the case of a stone-fruit they drop the stone and leave the seed to
germinate. A seed which is in danger of being swallowed is either hairy
like the rose-carpels (and therefore rejected because it irritates the
mouth unpleasantly), or it is enclosed in a hard or horny case, upon
which the animal’s digestive juices are unable to act. When the seed is
dropped it is no worse for its experience, and with good luck grows up
into a plant.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
<b>Eatable fruits generally conspicuous.</b>—In order that birds and
other animals may easily find the luscious fruits which they may
eat as a reward for scattering the seeds, such fruits are almost
always displayed very conspicuously, and are brilliantly coloured.
Oranges, plums, red currants, apples, etc., illustrate this fact well.
<b>Red</b> is perhaps the commonest colour of eatable fruits, because
it contrasts so strongly with the green colour of the foliage (<a href="#FIG_145">Fig. 145</a>).</p>

<p>1. <b>The male-fern.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Habit of growth.</i>—In summer dig up
a plant of the common male-fern (<a href="#FIG_146">Fig. 146</a>) and wash the soil
from the roots. Make out the short, stumpy, creeping <i>stem</i>, covered with the

<i>ground-tissue</i>. Cut the stem in halves lengthwise and carefully scrape
away the ground-tissue of one half to see how the harder conducting
strands are connected together. If you spoil this, try again on the
other half, after boiling it until it is softened.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The leaves.</i>—Make a drawing of one of the expanded leaves.
Notice that the leaf consists of a number of leaflets, and that these
are again cut up into segments, or are at least deeply lobed. Notice
the brown hairs clothing the leaf-stalk and the midrib.</p>

<p>Notice the crozier-like coiling of the young fronds, and make out that
when they uncoil the inside of the coil becomes the upper surface of the leaf.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The reproductive organs.</i>—Examine the lower surface of
full-grown fronds, and notice the brown rounded patches. Dry some
leaves bearing these patches and shake them over a sheet of paper.
Collect the brown dust which falls from the patches; it consists of
minute grains called <i>spores</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The prothallus.</i>—Sow some spores on damp soil sheltered
from the direct rays of the sun. Keep the soil moist, and notice that in a
few weeks the spores have grown into small, flat, green, heart-shaped
plants. Each of these is called a <i>prothallus</i>. Pick off prothalli of
different ages with a needle, float them in water, and compare the
various stages of growth. In old prothalli notice a young fern plant
springing up from the lower surface. Observe that as these become
larger the prothalli which bear them shrivel up and die.</p>

<p>2. <b>The bracken, fern.</b>—Dig up a bracken fern, wash the earth
from the roots, and compare it, point for point, with the male-fern.
Notice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) The long cylindrical, branching, underground <i>stem</i>.
Does it lie deeper in the ground than the stem of the male-fern? Cut the
stem across and compare the section with <a href="#FIG_148">Fig. 148</a>,
noting (i) the two concentric rings of separate <i>vascular strands</i>
(<i>s</i>). (ii) The <i>strengthening material</i>, arranged as a brown zone
(<i>lp</i>) just below the skin, and as an incomplete ring (<i>ll</i>) between
the two rings of vascular strands. (iii) The softer <i>ground-tissue</i>
(<i>R</i>), in which the vascular and strengthening strands are embedded.
Draw the external appearance of the stem (natural size), and also the
cross section (4 times natural size).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The roots.</i>—Describe the roots. Do they appear to arise from
any particular region of the stem?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The leaves.</i>—From what part of the stem do the leaves
arise? How many come up each year? What is the appearance of a young leaf
before it expands? How does it differ from that of the male-fern? Draw
a young leaf, and also an expanded one. Is the leaf simple or compound?
Does it branch? Does the leaf of the male-fern branch?</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The spores.</i>—Examine the under side of the leaf, and notice
the absence of the brown patches seen in the male-fern. Notice that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
edge of the bracken frond is folded over like a hem. Dry a frond, and
then run the point of your pencil under the fold and observe the brown
dust (spores) which is removed.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The prothalli.</i>—Sow some bracken spores on damp earth and
keep in a shaded place. Notice that the prothalli produced are very similar
to those of the male-fern. Watch their development and the growth, on
old prothalli, of a new generation of ferns.</p>
</div>

<p>3. <b>The hart’s tongue fern.</b>—Examine the hart’s tongue fern,
and notice how it differs from the two previous types. Are the leaves
simple or compound? Observe the brown trenches on the lower surface of
the leaf. Try to get out some spores by running the point of a pencil
along the trenches of a dried leaf. Sow the spores and try to raise
prothalli.</p>

<p><b>The daily life of a fern.</b>—The everyday life of a fern is very
similar to that of a flowering plant; for the organs by which it
obtains food are—broadly speaking—of the same type. Ferns are lovers
of damp and shady situations. The plant obtains its mineral food from
the soil by means of its roots; and its spreading green leaves, or
fronds, enable it, with the help of the sunlight, to decompose the
carbon dioxide of the air and to build up starch, sugars, and other
carbonaceous compounds.</p>

<p><b>The male-fern.</b>—The common male-fern (which, by the way, has no
sex whatever) may be taken as a type of the group. It occurs abundantly
in woods and hedgerows. The <b>stem</b>, or <b>rhizome</b>, is short
and stumpy; it grows obliquely upwards, and does not branch. It is
covered with old leaf-bases, which are clothed with brown, scaly
hairs. The stem consists of a rather soft ground-substance, in which
is embedded a hollow cylindrical network of conducting strands. In a
cross section these appear as a somewhat irregular ring of dots (<a href="#FIG_146">Fig. 146</a>, 2, <i>a</i>).
When the soft ground-tissue is carefully scraped away,  the network of
strands is left as a skeleton, with large diamond-shaped meshes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>The thin wiry <b>roots</b> spring from the bases of the leaf-stalks,
just where these come off the stem.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The <b>leaves</b> or fronds of the male-fern arise near the
growing-point (the upper end) of the stem. Leaves of almost all ages
are present. Those which surround the growing-point are mere rudiments;
while slightly older ones (<a href="#FIG_146">Fig. 146</a>, 1, <i>a</i>) are tightly
rolled up into a coil. During their growth the coils unfold, the inside of the
coil becoming the upper surface of the leaf. A fully expanded leaf is
roughly triangular in shape. The leaf-stalk and the midrib are covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
with brown, scaly hairs; and the blade of the leaf is divided into
several distinct leaflets, which are arranged on the midrib in two
rows. The leaflets are also in many cases sub-divided into separate
segments.</p>

<p><b>The spores.</b>—On the lower surface of many of the segments of a
male-fern frond may be seen a number of small, brown, kidney-shaped
scales (<a href="#FIG_146">Fig. 146</a>, 3, <i>a</i>). Each scale is attached to
the leaf by a short stalk, and the structure thus bears a rough resemblance to a
little umbrella. Attached to the bottom of the short “handle” of the
“umbrella” are several tiny boxes, somewhat like pill-boxes. These are
shown at <i>b</i> (<a href="#FIG_146">Fig. 146</a>, 3), and highly
magnified at 4 and 5. <a href="#FIG_146">Fig. 146</a>, 6,
represents a single box, more highly magnified. When ripe, each
box contains about fifty minute grains, which may thus be likened to
the pills in the pill-boxes. These “pills” are called <b>spores</b>.
Summing up thus far, we may say that the spores are formed in
spore-boxes, which are attached by stalks to the lower surface of the
frond, each group of spore-boxes being covered by a protective scale.</p>

<p><b>The scattering of the spores.</b>—When the spores are ripe, each
box (<a href="#FIG_146">Fig. 146</a>, 6) becomes dry, and is ultimately burst by
the sudden straightening of a spring (<i>c</i>) which is coiled round its edge.
The force of the uncoiling of the spring is sufficient to jerk the spores
(<i>d</i>) out of the box into the air, and they may be carried for some
distance by the wind before they at length reach the ground. Once
there, however, each spore, under favourable conditions, begins to
grow, and gives rise to a plant which, curiously enough, is not in the
least like the parent fern plant which produced the spore.</p>

<p><b>The difference between a spore and a seed.</b>—It is important to
notice that the spore is produced by a purely non-sexual process. In
this respect it differs widely from the seed of a flowering plant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
which, it will be remembered (<a href="#Page_92">p. 92</a>), results from
the union of the living matter of a pollen grain with that of an ovule.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

       the primary root (about 5 times nat. size).</p>
</div>

<p><b>The prothallus.</b>—The new plant, which is produced when a fern
spore germinates, is called a prothallus (<a href="#FIG_147">Fig. 147</a>, <i>A</i>).
It is a flat, filmy little plant, of the form which is generally called heart-shaped.
It has neither stem nor roots, but, as it contains green colouring
matter like that of leaves, and as it puts out on its lower surface
little hairs (<i>rh</i>) which take up watery solutions from the soil, it
is in no danger of starvation, and is quite capable of taking care of
itself and leading an independent existence. This tiny plant (a large
fern prothallus is perhaps half the size of a 3d. piece), in contrast
with its parent, produces sexual organs. Some of these organs (<i>an</i>)
give rise to male cells and others (<i>ar</i>) to female cells. The male
cells are excessively small, and can only be seen by high powers of the
microscope. When they are ripe they swim about in a drop of rain or
dew, as if they were little animals, and find their way to the female
cells, which they fertilise. The <b>embryo</b> which results from the
union grows up (<a href="#FIG_147">Fig. 147</a>, <i>B</i>) into an ordinary fern plant,
one being borne by each prothallus. In its young stages it is <i>parasitic</i> on the
prothallus, <i>i.e.</i> it depends entirely upon the prothallus for its
nutrition; but it soon develops a little leaf (<i>b</i>) and a root (<i>w</i>),
and henceforth feeds itself. When the young fern is well established in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
independent life, the prothallus shrivels up and dies. The
subsequently-formed roots of the fern are not branches of the primary
root, but spring from the bases of the leaves.</p>

<p><b>Alternation of generations.</b>—In the life-history of the
fern there are thus two very different generations. The first
generation—the ordinary fern, which is non-sexual—produces, by means
of spores, the sexual generation, called the prothallus. The prothallus
gives rise, in its turn, by a sexual process, to the obvious fern
plant. Each generation therefore resembles, not its parent, but its
grandparent.</p>

<p>The <b>bracken</b> or <b>brake fern</b> differs in several respects
from the male fern. Its cylindrical stem (rhizome) creeps along
horizontally beneath the ground, branching at intervals, by a division
of its growing point into two. Conducting strands run along the stem
and into the leaves and may be seen in cross section (<a href="#FIG_148">Fig. 148</a>, <i>s</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
to form two somewhat irregular, concentric rings. Strands and plates of
strengthening tissue (<i>l</i>) accompany them, and a cylindrical zone
(<i>lp</i>) of similar material also occurs just beneath the outside skin
(<i>e</i>) of the stem. The great advantage of having supporting structures
arranged as hollow cylinders has already (<a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a>) been referred
to. The rest of the stem consists of softer packing or ground-tissue, in which
starch is often stored.</p>

</div>

<p>The sappy stalk of a young bracken leaf is very sturdy; when it is only
six inches high the stalk may be already half an inch across at the
bottom, and half that thickness where it curls over at the top to form
a crook. The end of the leaf-stalk divides into three, each bearing
a frond which, at this stage, is coiled up tightly, looking somewhat
like a green caterpillar. At a later stage, the middle one of the three
branches commonly divides again into three, and the branching may
continue until the fully expanded leaf (<a href="#FIG_149">Fig. 149</a>) is very complex.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
The spore-boxes and contained <b>spores</b> of the bracken are very similar
to those of the male fern, but they are not collected in patches, like
those shown in <a href="#FIG_146">Fig. 146</a>, 3. Instead, they are arranged in
a row along the margin of the lower surface of the frond-segment; and the margin is
turned over—like a hem—so as to cover them in.</p>

<p>The spores are liberated in the usual way (<a href="#Page_187">p. 187</a>)
when ripe; and each germinates, under favourable conditions, to form a sexual
<b>prothallus</b>. Each prothallus gives rise to an <b>embryo</b>,
which is at first parasitic upon it, but presently grows up into an
ordinary bracken.</p>

<p><b>The hart’s tongue fern</b> (<a href="#FIG_150-151">Fig. 150</a>) has simple
and undivided leaves, which, as usual, bear spore-boxes upon the lower surface. In
this case the spore-boxes are produced in trenches, which appear to the
naked eye as oblique brown lines. Each trench is covered in by a pair
of thin flaps (<i>i</i>, <a href="#FIG_150-151">Fig. 151</a>). The life-history
closely resembles that already described for the male-fern and bracken.</p>

<h4>39. THE COMMON HORSETAIL.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Habit of growth.</b>—Carefully dig up a plant of the common
horsetail. Notice (<i>a</i>) the deep, creeping, underground <i>stems</i>; (<i>b</i>)
the thin wiry <i>roots</i> springing from the stem; (<i>c</i>) the two kinds
of upright shoots or <i>haulms</i>: one kind (<a href="#FIG_152-153">Fig. 152</a>)—to be
found in summer—being thin, and giving rise to tiers of green branches, which
come off like the ribs of an umbrella; the other kind (<a href="#FIG_152-153">Fig. 153</a>),
coming up in March, being paler in colour, without branches, and
bearing little <i>cones</i> at the apex.</p>

<p>2. <b>The underground stem.</b>—Make out that the stem is distinctly
divided into nodes—marked by toothed leaf-sheaths—and internodes.
Does it branch? Notice that some of the branches are swollen, forming
<i>tubers</i>.</p>

<p>3. <b>The roots.</b>—These are thin and wiry, and come off from the
stem. Do they come off at the nodes or at the internodes?</p>

<p>4. <b>The branched haulms.</b>—Observe that each is divided into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
nodes—marked by toothed leaf-sheaths—and internodes. Are the
internodes smooth or ridged? From what parts of the haulms do the
<i>lateral branches</i> arise? Carefully tear down a leaf-sheath to see its
relation to the branches. Notice that the branches themselves branch
repeatedly. What is the colour of the branches?</p>

<p>5. <b>The cone-bearing haulms.</b>—Do these haulms appear earlier or
later than the others? What is their colour? Does a cone-bearing haulm
give rise to branches at the nodes? Examine the cone with a lens and
see that it is covered with hexagonal scales. Does the hexagonal shape
allow the scales to be more closely packed? Take off a scale with a
needle and notice, with the help of a lens, the <i>spore-boxes</i> attached
to its inner surface.</p>

<p><b>The general appearance of the horsetail.</b>—The common horsetail
(<a href="#FIG_154">Fig. 154</a>), which may be found in hedgerows and cornfields,
is not in any respect showy. It rarely exceeds a few feet in height, and does
not attract attention by any display of bright colours. The plant has
stiff, jointed stems or <b>haulms</b>, standing gracefully erect and
bearing rings of small united leaves at intervals. The branches arise
just above the leaves, and alternate with them: several coming off at
each level, somewhat like the ribs of an umbrella. The whole plant has
thus a rather stiff and formal aspect.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
The haulms are very plainly of two kinds; for some, which are of a
pale colour, do not branch, and are developed merely to bear the
pretty little <b>cones</b> (<a href="#FIG_154">Fig. 154</a>, 1, <i>a</i>) which
appear at their upper ends. As the purpose of the cones is to give rise to the
next generation, the haulms which bear them may be called the fertile
haulms. They will be described presently, when the reproduction of the
plant is considered.</p>

<p><b>The sterile haulms.</b>—The erect branching shoots (<a href="#FIG_154">Fig. 154</a>, 2),
bear no organs of reproduction, and are hence referred to as
the sterile haulms. Their work is to provide the whole plant with
carbonaceous food, and it is on this account that their branches are
of the characteristic green tint. In most green plants the manufacture
of carbonaceous food (<a href="#Page_37">Chapter III.</a>) takes place mainly
in the leaves. In the horsetail, however, the leaves are small and of very little
importance in this respect, and the work is carried on by the sterile
haulms and their branches.</p>

<p><b>The underground stem and roots.</b>—A large part of the horsetail
plant is hidden beneath the surface of the ground, and often penetrates
to a great depth. In ordinary language these underground parts are
called roots. They are, however, subterranean <b>stems</b>, as is shown
quite plainly by the fact that they bear small leaf-sheaths like those
on the stems above ground. In the common horsetail the underground
stems often become swollen in parts by the formation of <i>tubers</i>
(<a href="#FIG_154">Fig. 154</a>), as is the case with the potato. The true <b>roots</b>
are very slender and thread-like, and spring from the nodes (<a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a>)
of the underground stems. They penetrate the soil in all directions, seeking
for water, which they take up by the fine hairs which clothe them, like
velvet-pile, a little behind their points. The stem and its haulms,
like those of grasses, are stiffened by <i>silica</i>, which is deposited in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the outer layers. This is of course obtained from the soil. It is not
absolutely necessary to the life of the plant, but it is nevertheless
very useful, as it enables the haulms to stand upright and spread out
their branches to the light and air.</p>

<p>The sterile branches are thus concerned with the horsetail’s daily
life. The roots provide it with water and mineral food, and the green
branches supply the necessary carbonaceous matter. Stem, branches, and
roots are permeated with a complete system of canals, through which the
food substances find their way to the various centres of activity.</p>

<p><b>The reproduction of the horsetail.</b>—It has been seen that
some of the haulms do not bear branches, but are set aside for the
production of the cones. These <b>fertile haulms</b> come up in
March, before the green sterile haulms appear. When the <b>cones</b>
are carefully examined they are seen to be covered by a number of
shield-shaped scales. To the inner side of each scale (<a href="#FIG_154">Fig. 154</a>, 3, 4)
are attached from five to ten boxes, each containing a large number
of little grains or <b>spores</b>. The boxes burst open when they are
ripe, about the end of March, liberating the spores; and the fertile
haulms, having performed the one duty for which they were developed, at
once die down.</p>

<p>If the spores fall in a favourable situation they germinate, and each
gives rise to a new plant. The new plant is, however, not a horsetail,
but a small filmy <b>prothallus</b>, somewhat like the prothallus
of a fern. Some of the prothalli produce male cells, while others
give rise to female cells. When the minute male cells are ripe, they
are set free, and are able, by means of fine, lashing threads, to
swim towards the female cells of a neighbouring prothallus, through
a drop of dew or rain. The two cells fuse together and give rise
to a little <b>embryo</b>, which in due course grows up into a new
plant—an ordinary horsetail with stems and branches and roots like its
grandparent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
<b>The advantage of an alternation of generations.</b>—The
life-history of the horsetail is evidently very similar to that of a
fern, each exhibiting a well-marked alternation of generations. There
is reason for believing that the prothallus-generation is the original
form, and that the ordinary fern and horsetail were developed simply to
scatter spores at intervals, and so to give new plants the advantages
of fresh soil.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Living and extinct horsetails.</b>—None of the British horsetails
is of great height, although one species may attain to six feet. Some
of the tropical members of the family, however, are very much larger
than this, reaching even forty feet. In spite of the last-named fact it
is quite plain that the horsetails have had their day, and are dying
out. If we wish to form an idea of what they were at the height of
their prosperity, we must carry our minds back to the long distant age
when our coal was being formed; when so much of this country as then
existed was low-lying swamp, covered with exuberant vegetation. Then
the horsetails and their relatives were stately forest trees, and at
the head of the vegetable kingdom. Some of them towered to a height of
over ninety feet. Nor did mere height constitute the only difference
between them and their degenerate descendants. Many of these old-world
giants had already found out the device, since invented afresh by more
modern plants, of thickening their stems and roots with secondary wood,
and of giving rise to bark like that of our present-day forest trees.
The wood of these <b>Calamites</b> (<a href="#FIG_155">Fig. 155</a>), as they are called by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
geologists, had already reached much the same stage of development
as is found to-day in such a tree as the yew. The cones often show
great variation from the comparatively simple form found in the modern
horsetail, but they are essentially of the same type.</p>

<p><b>Flowering and flowerless plants.</b>—Botanists divide plants into
two great groups—<b>flowering</b> plants, which reproduce themselves
by means of pollen grains and ovules; and <b>flowerless</b> plants,
which still retain the primitive marriage customs of their ancestors.
The flower is a comparatively recent invention in the history of plant
life, and its success is shown by the dominant position in the plant
world which the flowering plants now occupy.</p>

<p>Many of the flowerless plants—like the horsetails—have fallen
behind their competitors. The ferns, in spite of their conservatism,
still hold their own, and seem in no danger of extinction. Many other
flowerless plants maintain their position by sheer force of numbers.
Yet others have become completely extinct, and can now be known only by
their fossil remains. But these latter are sometimes so distinct that
stems, roots, and spore-boxes can be seen with all their sharpness of
outline unimpaired; the delicate tracery of frond and leaf is visible,
as clear and fresh as if made yesterday. And such rocky herbaria tell
us in unmistakable terms that our forest trees and other flowering
plants are after all mere parvenus and upstarts.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"> MOSSES, MUSHROOMS, AND MOULDS.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>40. LIVERWORTS AND TRUE MOSSES.</h4>

<p>1. <b>A common liverwort.</b>—Look along the sides of a brook or
a well, and try to find a flat green plant with numerous lobed and
overlapping branches. Each branch is perhaps half an inch across. This
is one of the commonest liverworts (<i>Pellia</i>). Notice the prominent
midrib running along each branch. In spring, observe the “frilled”
appearance of the end, caused by the small new branches.</p>

<p>Pull the plant up, and notice that it is attached to the soil by a
large number of fine <i>hairs</i> which spring from the lower surface of the
midrib.</p>

<p>In February, or March, examine the upper surface of the growing plant
with a lens, and notice the small, dark-green balls, mounted on short,
thick stalks. Examine these at intervals until May, and notice that
the stalks then grow rapidly until they are two or three inches long.
Each is white, and still bears the black ball (the <i>capsule</i>) on its
summit. When the stalk is full-grown, the capsule opens—its wall
splitting into four parts—to liberate the <i>spores</i>. How soon, after
the liberation of the spores, do the capsule and its stalk die down?</p>

<p>2. <b>A common moss.</b>—Separate a single plant from a tuft of the
common moss (<i>Funaria</i>) which grows, almost everywhere, on the ground
and on walls. Notice that the plant consists of a <i>stem</i> perhaps half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
an inch high, thickly covered with small simple green <i>leaves</i>. The
moss is fixed in the soil by a tuft of fine <i>hairs</i>.</p>

<p>On some of the plants notice a thin stalk (about half an inch long)
springing from the top of the stem; and on the end of the stalk an
ovoid <i>capsule</i> or spore-box. In cases where the stalk is not yet
full-grown, notice that the capsule is covered by a conical <i>hood</i>,
somewhat like a candle-extinguisher.</p>

<p>Select a plant bearing a ripe capsule, and warm it gently before the
fire—holding it over a sheet of paper—to dry it. Examine the mouth of
the capsule with a lens, and try to see the teeth which surround the
opening. Then shake the capsule over moist soil in a small flower-pot
to scatter the <i>spores</i>; cover with a sheet of glass and keep in a
warm room. In a few days notice that the soil is covered with fine green
threads. Ultimately new moss plants will grow from these.</p>

<p><b>The life-history of a liverwort.</b>—One of the commonest and
simplest of this class of plants is known to botanists as <i>Pellia</i>.
It may generally be found growing by the sides of streams or old wells.
It has neither stem, leaves, nor root, but consists of flat, green,
overlapping lobes which fork at their ends. It branches very freely,
and in spring the new branches give the ends of the lobes a frilled
appearance. A rather prominent midrib runs along each branch. The plant
is attached to the soil by a large number of fine hairs which spring
from the lower surface of the midrib.</p>

<p>The whole appearance of this liverwort is very suggestive of the
prothallus (<a href="#FIG_147">Fig. 147</a>) of a fern; and, indeed, it corresponds
to a prothallus, not only in its general structure and mode of life, but
also in bearing sexual organs of a very similar type. It was seen in
<a href="#Page_183">Chapter X.</a> that a fern prothallus at length produces an
embryo, which grows up and forms the spore-bearing generation which is what people
usually understand by a “fern”.</p>

<div class="figleft">
    <a name="FIG_156" id="FIG_156"></a>
    <img src="images/i_202.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="425" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 156.</span>—A Moss. <i>A</i>,<br />
        a plant with spore-case<br /> still covered by hood (<i>c</i>)<br />
         (×&nbsp;1). <i>B</i>, a plant with ripe<br />
        spore-case (<i>k</i>); <i>s</i>, stalk;<br /> <i>d</i>, lid; <i>rh</i>, hairs
       (×&nbsp;1). <i>C</i>,<br /> mature spore-case with<br />
         lid (<i>d</i>) removed; <i>p</i>, fringe<br />of teeth (×&nbsp;3).</p>
</div>

<p>The liverwort also gives rise to a spore-bearing generation, but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
this case it consists merely of a small, round, spore-box, dark-green
in colour, which is carried on the summit of a white stalk—the whole
looking somewhat like a stout pin. In February, or early March, the
spore-boxes may be seen upon the upper surface of the plant as small
balls, perhaps one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter, protruding from
the mouth of a little pocket in which their early stages are passed.
About May, their stalks lengthen so rapidly that in a few days the
spore-boxes are lifted to a height of two or three inches. Then each
box opens by its wall splitting into four, and the spores are liberated
to germinate and form new liverworts. Having thus shed the spores, the
box and stalk die down.</p>

<p>The complete life-cycle of a liverwort thus includes two unlike
generations, as that of a fern does; but it is a different generation
which attains the greater development in the two cases. The ordinary
fern is the spore-bearing generation; the “ordinary” liverwort is the
sexual generation, and its sporing offspring is not a separate plant at
all, but a mere stalked box, almost entirely dependent upon its parent.</p>

<p><b>The mosses.</b>—A moss-plant appears at first sight to be very
similar in its general features to one of the higher plants; for
it has a little stem, bearing flattened green leaves which build
up carbonaceous food in the usual way. It has no true roots, but
fine hairs penetrate the soil and do the work of roots by taking up
solutions of mineral food. It is all the more remarkable, therefore,
to find from its method of reproduction that the moss-plant belongs
to the generation which corresponds to the prothallus stage of a
fern’s life-history, and not to the leafy, sporing generation which it
somewhat resembles superficially.</p>

<p>The sexual organs of a moss are essentially of the same type as those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
which a prothallus bears, and here also the tiny male cells gain access
to the female cells by swimming through a drop of rain or dew. The
result of fertilisation is an embryo which, however, grows up to form,
not a plant with stem and leaves, but a stalked spore-case only.</p>

<p>In a tuft of the moss <i>Funaria</i>, which is so common in all country
places, several stages of development of the spore-cases may usually
be seen. <a href="#FIG_156">Fig. 156</a> represents a moss which is very similar to <i>Funaria</i>
but larger. In <i>A</i>, the spore-case is still covered by a conical
hood (<i>c</i>). In <i>B</i>, the stalk (<i>s</i>) has grown much longer, and
the hood has dropped off. The spore-case or capsule (<i>k</i>) is now seen to
be a pear-shaped body, closed by the lid (<i>d</i>). When the spores are
ripe, the lid becomes detached. The mouth of the nodding capsule is
still blocked, however, by a number of teeth (<a href="#FIG_156">Fig. 156</a>, <i>C</i>, <i>p</i>)
which remain close together in damp weather. In dry weather the teeth
separate, and allow the spores to fall out. When a moss spore falls in
a favourable situation it germinates to form a fine, branching network
of green threads, from which new moss-plants arise as buds.</p>

<p>The obvious plant of a moss—like that of a liverwort—therefore
corresponds to the prothallus generation of a fern or horsetail.
Its sporing generation, corresponding to the obvious fern-plant or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
horsetail, is a stalked spore-case, which is always more or less
dependent on its parent and dies down as soon as its work of scattering
the spores is accomplished.</p>

<h4>41. THE COMMON MUSHROOM.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Habit of growth.</b>—In what situations do you find mushrooms
growing? In what kinds of weather and at what time of the year are they
most abundant? Take up a mushroom with a trowel, and carefully wash the
earth from the lower part to see the tangle of white threads (called
the <i>mycelium</i>), which is the underground part of the plant. See that
several of these run into the bottom of the stalk. On the underground
mycelium look for young mushrooms in the “button” stage. Look around,
and try to get a series of mushrooms showing all stages from the
smallest buttons to fully-opened specimens.</p>

<p>2. <b>Structure.</b>—Draw a side view (natural size) of a full-grown
mushroom, showing the <i>stalk</i> and <i>cap</i>. Running round the stalk notice
a ragged flap, called the <i>collar</i>. What is the height of the collar
from the base of the stalk? Examine younger mushrooms to find what
the collar really is. Notice that in young specimens a membrane or
<i>veil</i> stretches from the edge of the cap to the stalk, and that as
the mushroom grows larger this veil is torn away from the cap (<a href="#FIG_157">Fig. 157</a>),
and remains as a ragged flap (the collar) on the stalk. In young
specimens, therefore, the lower side of the cap is completely shut in
by the veil, while in fully-grown ones it is exposed.</p>

<p>3. <b>The gills and spores.</b>—Cut the stalk across at the top, and
make a drawing of the lower surface of the cap. Notice the radiating
vertical plates (the <i>gills</i>), and their flesh-coloured or dark-brown
tint. Be careful to show the exact arrangement of the gills in, say,
a quarter of the drawing. Cut off the cap of a mushroom which has
brown gills and lay it, gills down, on a sheet of paper; cover it with
a tumbler to shield it from draughts, and leave it for a day. Then
take off the cap (being careful not to smear it along the paper), and
observe the radiating brown lines. On touching them, it will be seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
that the lines consist of fine brown dust. The particles of dust are
<i>spores</i>. They have evidently fallen from the gills.</p>

<p>4. <b>The source of the mushroom’s food.</b>—What is the colour of
the mushroom? Cut through the stalk and cap in various directions and
notice the pure white “flesh” of the interior. Do you think it likely
that the plant can obtain carbonaceous food from the air? Why not?
Dry a mushroom and burn it carefully. Does it contain <i>carbon</i>? Where
must the carbon have come from, if not from the air. Can you find any
decaying vegetable or animal matter in the soil in which mushrooms grow?</p>

<p>5. <b>Toadstools.</b>—Carefully compare the common mushroom with other
gilled fungi which look somewhat like it. Notice particularly the
following characters: the colour, shape, and texture of the surface of
the cap; the colour and arrangement of the gills; the proportions of
the length and thickness of the stalk to the diameter of the cap; the
presence or absence of a collar on the stalk; the presence or absence
of a cup, or scaly swelling, at the base of the stalk.</p>

<p>The following <b>precautions</b> are necessary in selecting mushrooms
for food: Never eat a “button” mushroom; in this stage wholesome and
poisonous mushrooms cannot be properly distinguished from each other.
Reject all mushrooms which show signs of a <i>cup</i> or a scaly swelling at
the base of the stalk—especially if they have also <i>white spores</i> and
a collar.</p>

<p><b>The common meadow mushroom.</b>—The common mushroom (<a href="#FIG_157">Fig. 157</a>)
may easily be found in meadows, especially in autumn and after damp
weather in summer. The part which rises above the surface of the ground
consists of a stout <b>stalk</b>, about three inches long and perhaps
three-quarters of an inch thick. On the upper end of the stalk is a
circular horizontal <b>cap</b>, convex and smooth above and concave
below; with a diameter about equal to the length of the stalk. The
interior of the stalk and cap is composed of a firm white fleshy
substance. The underground part of the plant consists of a tangle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
fine white threads, most of which are woven together into strands; and
it is easy to see that several of these strands run into the base of
the stalk. Each of the fine threads is called a <b>hypha</b>, and the
network which they together compose is known as the <b>mycelium</b>. It
has indeed been found by microscopic examination that the whole plant
is built up of such hyphae—closely packed together in the stem and
cap, more loosely aggregated in the underground strands. The stalk of
the full-grown mushroom bears, a little above its middle, a ragged ring
of tissue—the <b>collar</b>. This ring is the remains of a membrane or
<b>veil</b> which in the younger stages reached to the edge of the cap,
completely enclosing its lower surface; but which was torn off the cap
(<a href="#FIG_157">Fig. 157</a>) as the stalk of the “button” mushroom elongated.</p>

<div class="figright">
    <a name="FIG_157" id="FIG_157"></a>
    <img src="images/i_205.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="214" />

        To the right,<br /> mushroom in<br /> “button” stage (×&nbsp;½).</p>
</div>

<p><b>The reproduction of the mushroom.</b>—The lower side of the cap of
a mature mushroom bears a very large number of radiating plates called
the <b>gills</b>. These are at first pink, but the colour afterwards
changes to a dark brown. Each gill produces an immense number of
extremely fine <b>spores</b>, too small to be seen individually by the
naked eye. When, however, the cap of a mushroom is laid, gills down,
on a sheet of paper and protected from draughts, a “spore print” is
obtained; the dust of the fallen spores marks the positions of the
gills in brown radial lines. Quite recently it has been found possible
to raise new mushroom plants by germinating the spores, and there can
be no doubt that this is the natural method of reproduction.</p>

<p><b>The method of life of the mushroom.</b>—The mushroom, like all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
plants we have studied, thus consists of parts which perform one or
other of two duties; that of feeding the plant, and that of continuing
the race. In this case the food is supplied <i>entirely</i> by the
underground mycelium; while the aërial part, consisting of stalk and
cap, is concerned only with the work of scattering the spores. There is
nothing corresponding to the leaf-green of the higher plants, and the
mushroom is therefore unable to make use of the carbon dioxide of the
air (<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>) as the source of the carbonaceous food which
is necessary for its life. Carbonaceous and mineral food alike are obtained from
the soil by the underground mycelium. The plant is, in short, dependent
upon carbonaceous food which has been previously built up by some
other plant or animal, and can therefore grow only in soil containing
decaying animal or vegetable matter. It would be quite unable to
subsist upon the nutritive solution of salts which was seen (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>)
to suffice (when supplemented by fresh air) for green plants.</p>

<p><b>Fungi.</b>—The mushroom belongs to a class of plants called the
Fungi, all of which obtain their carbonaceous food ready-made from some
other plant or animal, living or dead. For this reason many fungi are
parasitic upon other living plants. Most of the diseases of crops and
of forest trees are due to fungi. The moulds which destroy food are
fungi, and the dry rot which ruins timber is caused by organisms of the
same class.</p>

<p><b>Toadstools.</b>—The common meadow mushroom is a justly-esteemed
article of food, but some other gilled fungi, which are intensely
<b>poisonous</b>, bear a sufficiently close resemblance to mushrooms
to render them dangerous. The student should therefore take every
opportunity of examining these, and of comparing them with the edible
mushroom in the manner described on <a href="#Page_204">p. 204</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<h4>42. MOULDS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The growth of moulds.</b>—Damp three small slices of bread, and
cover them with tumblers to prevent them from drying. Expose one slice
to ordinary daylight; keep another in a dark place at about the same
temperature; and submit the third to the direct rays of bright sunlight
as much as possible.</p>

<p>2. <b>White mould</b> (<i>Mucor</i>).—In one or two days observe that the
bread is covered with white fleecy threads. Some of these may grow to
a height of an inch or more, and end in small black knobs which can be
seen with the naked eye. The knobs contain <i>spores</i>. Examine the mould
with the help of a lens. On which of the three pieces of bread is there
most mould, and on which the least?</p>

<p>Mix freshly-boiled and strained juice of stewed fruit (preferably
colourless or nearly so) with an equal quantity of water. Half fill a
small glass with the mixture, and with the point of a needle add a few
spores from the mould on the bread. Cover the glass, avoid shaking it,
and examine day by day. Notice the delicate threads (<i>hyphae</i>) of the
<i>mycelium</i> which spreads over the liquid and sends down branches below
the surface. Observe also the hyphae which grow up into the air and
bear spore-knobs at the end. Similarly, sow some of the spores on a
little of the nutritive solution of salts (<a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>) contained
in a clean glass. Do these spores also develop into moulds? Why not?</p>

<p>Scratch through the skin of a ripe fruit (<i>e.g.</i> plum, apple, grape,
etc.) with a needle, and lay the fruit aside with the scratch upward.
Scratch a similar fruit in the same way, and rub into the scratch a few
mould-spores before laying it aside. With these put a third fruit which
has a perfectly whole skin. Compare the fruits after a few days.</p>

<p>3. <b>Blue mould</b> (<i>Penicillium</i>).—After some days the white mould
on the bread will probably be crowded out by a blue or greenish velvety
mould called <i>Penicillium</i>. Examine it with a lens. As with <i>Mucor</i>,
make experiments as to the action of light upon this mould; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
germination of its spores (which form a greenish powder on the ends of
the short aërial hyphae) in fruit-juice; and the action of the spores
upon ripe fruits.</p>

<p><b>Common moulds.</b>—In the dust floating about in the air the spores
of certain moulds are almost always present. When these spores fall
upon materials which—like bread, fruit, old leather, etc.—are capable
of affording them suitable food-substances, they germinate and form the
woolly growths which are familiar to everyone.</p>

<p><b>The white mould</b> (<i>Mucor</i>).—What is known familiarly as white
mould, and botanically as <b>Mucor</b>, is very convenient for study
on account of its abundance and large size. If a piece of bread is
kept in a damp atmosphere it generally becomes covered, after a day
or two, with a fleecy growth of the white threads of this mould.
These may attain a height of an inch or more, and many of them bear
at their ends a small black knob, in which the spores are formed.
When mature, the knobs burst open, and the fine spores are scattered
in the air. The various parts of the mould are best seen in position
by scattering some of the spores, or a little dust from a shelf, upon
the surface of clear, colourless fruit-juice in a glass vessel, and
following the stages of growth with a lens. It then becomes clear that
the mould—like the mushroom—consists of (<i>a</i>) a buried tangle or
mycelium of hyphal threads which take in the plant’s food, and of (<i>b</i>)
an aërial part which scatters the spores. The mould also resembles the
mushroom in not containing the green colouring matter possessed by the
higher plants, and therefore in being dependent upon ready-made organic
food. Provided with this, it can grow freely even in the dark.</p>

           An aërial hypha with its<br />terminal spore-brushes.<br />(×&nbsp;360).</p>
</div>

<p><b>Blue mould</b> (<i>Penicillium</i>).—It is generally found that the
fleecy hyphae of <i>Mucor</i>, which first cover the damp bread, are crowded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
out in a short time by the growth of another mould, which is known to
botanists as <b>Penicillium</b>. This also consists of a mycelium,
which penetrates the nutritive substance, and of aërial hyphae which
produce spores. Here, however, the spores are not borne in cases, but
break off from the ends of brush-like branches of the aërial hyphae
(<a href="#FIG_158">Fig. 158</a>). The spores of <i>Penicillium</i> are
greenish-blue in colour, and it is from this circumstance that the
mould receives its common name. The colour is, however, quite different
from the leaf-green which gives the higher plants the power, in
sunlight, of decomposing the carbon dioxide of the air and building up
their own carbonaceous food—a power which neither <i>Penicillium</i> nor any
other fungus possesses.</p>

<p><b>The smallest plants.</b>—The description of microscopic organisms
is beyond the scope of this book, but the student ought to realise that
by far the greater number of plants are quite invisible to the naked
eye. Some of these—to be found in every pond and ditch—are green,
and, though they are of very simple structure, they obtain their food
in a manner substantially resembling that adopted by a flowering-plant
or a fern. Others, like the yeast plant, are fungi, and are subject to
the limitations in food-supply which are characteristic of that class.
The smallest of all plants are the <b>bacteria</b>; they are almost
inconceivably minute, yet they possess an influence upon the health and
wellbeing of mankind which it is impossible to over-estimate.

</div>

<h4>43. THE RABBIT: HABITS AND APPEARANCE.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The habits of the wild rabbit.</b>—In what places have you known
wild rabbits to have a <i>warren</i>? In what kind of ground is a rabbit
warren generally found? How can you recognise it? Are all the holes
of the warren of similar size, or can you distinguish between main
entrances and “bolt-holes”? Look for smooth paths, perhaps nine inches
wide, which lead to the main entrances and intersect each other, so
as to form “runs.” Watch the animals feeding and playing; to do this
successfully it will be necessary to keep very still and silent; avoid
walking on the runs. What do the rabbits eat? Do they walk, or hop?
How do they run? Notice how conspicuous is the white tail of a running
rabbit. In June look for a nest of young rabbits. The position of such
a nest may often be recognised, when the doe is away from home, by a
smooth patch of earth with which she has covered up the hole. Dig up
this very carefully and notice how the nest is lined. Examine the young
ones without hurting them, and then cover them up again.</p>

<p>What is the <i>colour</i> of a wild rabbit? Does the colour render the
animal less conspicuous? Are tame rabbits so often of this colour? Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
not? Watch a tame rabbit, noticing especially the movements of its
nostrils, whiskers, and ears, and its method of feeding. Try to see how
it gnaws the bars of its hutch.</p>

<p>2. <b>Fur.</b>—Examine a dead rabbit. With what is the skin covered?
What are the differences between the fur of a rabbit, the hair of a
dog, and the wool of a sheep? Is fur curly? Does it lie flat on the
skin? Does it consist of different sizes of hair—short, fine hairs and
long, thicker ones? What other animals do you know which have fur?</p>

<p>3. <b>The head.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>The whiskers.</i>—On what parts of the
head are the longest hairs found? How do these differ, apart from length,
from ordinary hairs? What other common animals have whiskers? Do such
animals often make their way through narrow passages? What do you
suppose is the use of the whiskers?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The skull.</i>—Feel the bones of the head through the skin,
and make out the rounded brain-case, the ridge above and the arch below
each eye, and the positions of the jaws.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The external ears.</i>—Examine the large ear-flaps. Notice
that the upper parts are thin and almost transparent, and that the lower
parts are gristly and lead into the interior of the head.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The eyes.</i>—Notice that the eyes are at the <i>sides</i>
of the head. Is this position an advantage to the rabbit? Examine, in each
eye, the upper and lower lids; and also, in the angle of the eye next
the nose, the <i>third eyelid</i>—a fold of white skin. Take hold of
this fold with the forceps and see that it is easily pulled over the
eyeball. Look in a mirror and see the little fleshy body which occupies
a similar position in your own eye; this corresponds to the rabbit’s
third eyelid. In the visible part of the rabbit’s eyeball notice the
round dark <i>pupil</i> in the middle (contrast the pupil of a cat’s eye);
the coloured ring (the <i>iris</i>) surrounding the pupil; and the “white”
(called the <i>sclerotic</i>) surrounding the iris.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The lips and nostrils.</i>—Notice how the upper lip is split
in the middle line, so as to show the front teeth. What is the use of the
split? Notice the grooves passing from the upper lip to the nostrils.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>The inside of the mouth.</i>—Open the rabbit’s mouth and notice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(i) The two gnawing or <i>incisor teeth</i> in the lower jaw, and the pair
of strongly-grooved incisors which are so conspicuous in the upper jaw.
Just behind the large, upper incisors two smaller incisors may be felt
with the finger. Separated by a wide space from the incisors are the
<i>grinding teeth</i>—six on each side in the upper jaw, and five on each
side in the lower jaw.</p>

<p>(ii) The <i>tongue</i>, lying between the halves of the lower jaw.</p>

<p>(iii) The hard <i>ridges</i> running across the fore half of the roof of the
mouth.</p>

<p>(iv) The <i>hairiness</i> of the inside of each cheek, between the incisor
and grinding teeth.</p>
</div>

<p>4. <b>The neck.</b>—Notice how the neck enables the head to be turned
freely in various directions without the body being moved. Feel through
the skin and identify:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) In front of the neck, the <i>trachea</i> or windpipe, with the
<i>larynx</i> or “voice box” at its upper end between the halves of the
lower jaw.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The bones of the neck-part of the <i>spine</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>5. <b>The trunk.</b>—Feel through the skin and make out the <i>spine</i>,
the <i>breast-bone</i>, and the curved <i>ribs</i> which connect these. The
spine, breast-bone, and ribs together form a bony cage which encloses
the fore-part (the <i>thorax</i>) of the body. The hinder and larger part of
the body (the <i>abdomen</i>) is not protected by ribs, but the bones of the
spine are largest and stoutest in this part of the body.</p>

<p>6. <b>The limbs.</b>—How many limbs has the rabbit? Which pair is the
longer? Is the difference in length an assistance in leaping? Make out
the main divisions of each limb, and, by feeling through the skin, the
manner of attachment of its bones to the bones of the body (<a href="#FIG_161">Fig. 161</a>).</p>

<p>7. <b>The tail.</b>—Notice the length, shape, position, and colour of
the tail. The chain of bones inside it is a prolongation of the spine.</p>

<p><b>Methods of studying animals.</b>—In studying animals, methods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
similar in principle to those described in previous chapters for plants
should be employed. A real knowledge of the <b>habits</b> of animals
can only be obtained by watching them as closely as possible in their
natural surroundings. It is often very difficult to get sufficiently
close to shy animals to see them distinctly without causing alarm, and
a good field-glass is a valuable help in such cases. A great deal of
first-hand knowledge of wild life can, however, be gained without such
aids if the student will learn to move quietly and silently, and to
remain motionless as soon as he is in a good position for observation.
The books of such masters of woodcraft as Richard Jefferies, William
J. Long, Ernest Thompson Seton, and W. H. Hudson give charming
descriptions of the methods of tracking and studying wild animals, and
should be carefully read by every field-naturalist. Observations made
in the field should be at once recorded, with the date, in a note book.</p>

<p>Many animals can be kept for some time, without cruelty, in
confinement; and a more intimate knowledge of certain of their habits
can be thus obtained. The practice of keeping <b>pets</b> is, however,
to be encouraged only when every possible care is taken to secure the
comfort of the captives.</p>

<p>To understand the internal structure of an animal, <b>dissection</b>
is necessary. This consists in exposing and separating the internal
organs of the dead animal from each other, in order to notice their
mutual relation. A careful outline drawing of every dissection should
be made and preserved. The student should make it a rule never to kill
<i>any</i> animal unless for some useful purpose, and then to do so in the
quickest and most painless manner.</p>

<p><b>The habits of the rabbit.</b>—Wild rabbits live in <b>burrows</b>
or underground passages which they excavate, by means of their strong
feet, in the soil of sandbanks, fields, woods, etc. The animals
are sociable, and the burrows belonging to any one community are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
collectively known as a <b>warren</b>. The passages of the warren
communicate with the outside world by means of openings, some of which
are in common use, while others seem to be used mainly as “bolt-holes”
in cases of sudden alarm. A rabbit which is bolting to its burrow
exposes the white underside of its tail, and thus acts as a danger
signal and guide to its fellows. When a rabbit is startled, or puzzled
by seeing some unusual object, it generally thumps the ground smartly
with its long hind-foot; other rabbits in the neighbourhood are thereby
warned.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_159" id="FIG_159"></a>
    <img src="images/i_215.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="323" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 159.</span>—Rabbits.</p>
</div>

<p>It is common to find, outside a rabbit warren, a number of intersecting
paths, perhaps nine inches wide, and worn smooth by the patter of
little feet. These are the highways, or “runs,” which lead from the
holes of the warren to the various feeding-grounds.</p>

<p>Rabbits breed very rapidly; it has been estimated that in five years a
single pair might have about a million descendants, were it not for the
countless mishaps to which rabbits are exposed. The young are born and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
suckled in a special shallow burrow, which the doe excavates and lines
with dry leaves, fur, etc. When she leaves the nest for any purpose she
covers up the entrance with soil.</p>

<p>The proportions of the parts of the body of a very young rabbit are
markedly different from those of the adult. The head is relatively
larger, the tail longer, and the ears shorter; while the hind limbs
and fore limbs are of almost equal length. During the first six months
of its life the animal gradually takes on the proportions of the
adult—with small head, long ears, large hind legs with long feet, and
small, upwardly-turned tail.</p>

<p>A rabbit is able to stand upright on its hind legs, and to maintain
itself in this position for a considerable time. It thus obtains a
wider view and a greater choice of food.</p>

<p>The great difference in the length of the fore and hind legs gives
the animal a characteristic gait. “In a freely moving rabbit,” says
Jefferies, “both fore-feet stop when the hinder come up—one hinder
foot slightly behind the other, and rather wide apart.” Rabbits are
exclusively vegetarian feeders, living on green herbs and on the tender
shoots and bark of shrubs and young trees.</p>

<p><b>The external characters of the rabbit.</b>—The outside of the
rabbit’s body is almost entirely covered with <b>fur</b>. This consists
of two kinds of hair—coarse and fine. The coarser hairs are fewer in
number and longer than the fine ones, which they protect from wet. The
fine hairs are extremely closely-set, and stand straight out from the
skin. In a seal-skin coat only the short hairs of the fur are to be
found; the longer hairs have been removed by the dressing process. The
great warmth of furs is due to the air which is entangled between the
fine, close hairs. It is generally the case that fur-bearing animals
are exposed to either mud or wet by their method of life; in spite of
this fact, while the hair of a dog soon becomes wetted by rain, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
wool of a sheep retains a great deal of dirt, furred animals are noted
for keeping their coats clean and dry.</p>

<p>The longest hairs of the rabbit are the stiff <b>whiskers</b> which
stand out from the upper lip, the cheeks, and above the eyes. They are
extremely sensitive to touch, and are of great assistance to the animal
in finding its way through the dark burrows.</p>

<p>The <b>colour</b> of the wild rabbit is greyish brown, except
on the belly and under the tail, where it is white. This colour
harmonises well with the surroundings, and renders the animal much
less noticeable. Wild rabbits are exposed to so many enemies, that
individuals which happen to be born with conspicuously coloured fur
have generally but a poor chance of surviving and leaving offspring
to inherit their disadvantages. There is thus in each generation a
<b>natural selection</b> of the animals which are best protected,
by their colour, from observation. Among tame rabbits, on the other
hand, <b>protective colouration</b> is of very little importance, and
one variation of colour is as likely as another to be transmitted by
<b>heredity</b> to the next generation.</p>

<p><b>The regions of the body.</b>—For convenience and precision in
describing animals it is customary to use the words <b>anterior</b> and
<b>posterior</b> to indicate the fore, or head, end, and the hind, or
tail, end respectively. The belly-surface is said to be <b>ventral</b>,
and the back <b>dorsal</b>.</p>

<p>The body of a rabbit obviously consists of head, trunk, a short tail,
and four limbs. The general arrangement of the bony framework, or
<b>skeleton</b>, (<a href="#FIG_161">Fig. 161</a>) which supports the softer parts
may be felt through the skin. The skeleton consists of (1) the <i>skull</i>;
(2) the spine or <i>vertebral column</i> (generally spoken of as the backbone),
placed dorsally, and reaching from the anterior end of the neck into
the tail; (3) the ventral <i>sternum</i> or breast-bone, which is connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
with the vertebral column by means of curved <i>ribs</i>; (4) the bones of
the two pairs of limbs, with the shoulder-and hip-bones to which they
are attached. The bones will be studied in more detail in the next
chapter.</p>

<p>The trunk is divided into two regions—an anterior <b>thorax</b>,
or chest, (enclosed in the bony cage formed by the ribs, sternum,
and the adjoining part of the vertebral column), and a posterior
<b>abdomen</b>. The two cavities are divided from each other by a
fleshy partition called the <i>diaphragm</i>.</p>

<p><b>Organs of special sense.</b>—In addition to the sense of touch
which is possessed by the whole surface of the body, the rabbit has
organs which enable it to distinguish objects by sight, sounds, scents,
and taste. Its sense of <b>smell</b> is so keen that, to be successful
in snaring rabbits, “in walking to the spot selected for the snare it
is best to avoid even stepping on the run, and while setting it up to
stand back as far as convenient and lean forward. The grass that grows
near must not be touched by the hand, which seems to impart a very
strong scent. The stick that has been carried in the hand must not be
allowed to fall across the run; and be careful that your handkerchief
does not drop out of your pocket on or near it. If a bunch of grass grows very
tall and requires parting, part it with the end (not the handle) of your
stick.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The shape of the <b>ear-flaps</b>, which can be turned in different
directions (<a href="#FIG_159">Fig. 159</a>), enables the rabbit to
catch very slight sounds.</p>

<p>The <b>eyes</b> are placed on the <i>sides</i> of the head, so that the
animal has a wide field of view, and an enemy approaching from behind
is not likely to be unnoticed. The eye of the rabbit is very similar in
structure to our own, but it possesses one useful adjunct which ours
has lost, in the shape of a <i>third eyelid</i>—an opaque flap of skin
which lies in the inner angle, and can be drawn over the eyeball at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
will. The little fleshy nodule in the corresponding position of the
human eye is a rudiment of a similar structure.</p>

<p><b>The rabbit a gnawing animal.</b>—Rabbits are much addicted to
gnawing young trees for the sake of the bark and the softer juicy
tissues between bark and wood. Even tame rabbits exhibit the same
instinct by gnawing their wooden hutches, although these are of
no use as food. The gnawing is done by the sharp teeth, called
<b>incisors</b>, which are conspicuous in the middle of both upper and
lower jaw. In the upper jaw two incisors (which are so deeply grooved
that they look like four) are visible even when the mouth is closed,
owing to the split in the middle of the upper lip. The hardest part of
the tooth (a substance called <i>enamel</i>) is at the front. Behind this
the tooth is composed of a softer, bony material called <i>dentine</i>; and
the back of the tooth consists of still softer dentine. The result
of these differences in the composition of the various parts of the
tooth is that the gnawing of hard substances wears away the back of
the tooth most, the middle part next, and the front least of all; and
thus a sharp chisel-edge is always maintained. Moreover, <i>the teeth of
the rabbit never stop growing</i>, so that they never become appreciably
shorter through use. Immediately behind the two visible incisors of
the upper jaw, another and smaller pair can be felt by the finger; the
enamel-faces of these are directed backwards towards the cavity of the
mouth. The softer and more easily worn faces of the two pairs of upper
incisors are thus in contact, and are continually worn down to form a
groove. Into this groove the two incisors of the lower jaw bite. The
incisor teeth stand well out from the jaws, and the split upper lip
can be drawn back, so that the lips are not injured by gnawing. In the
hinder part of the mouth, where the chewing, or <b>mastication</b>, of
the food takes place, are six flatter but cross-ridged <b>grinding teeth</b>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
on each side of the upper jaw, and five on each side of the
lower jaw. The insides of the cheeks are protected from sharp splinters
of wood by a patch of <b>hair</b> on each side, which extends from the
region of the incisors to the grinding teeth behind. The roof of the
mouth is protected by hard cross-ridges, and the tongue by tough skin.</p>

<p><b>Rodents.</b>—Rabbits and hares, rats and mice, and squirrels are
said to be rodents (Lat. <i>rodo</i>, I gnaw), as they not only agree in the
gnawing habit, but also in other very important respects.</p>

<p><b>Mammals.</b>—Rodents, and all other animals which suckle their
young, are included by naturalists in the class Mammalia. These animals
agree further in breathing air, in having warm blood, and in being more
or less completely covered with hair.</p>

<p><b>Vertebrates.</b>—Mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes
are grouped together to form the sub-kingdom Vertebrata. They are given
this name because they all possess a spinal, or vertebral, column
(which usually consists largely of a chain of bones), running below the
dorsal surface (<a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a>) of the body, from neck to tail.</p>

<p><b>The position of the rabbit in the animal kingdom.</b>—It is
clear from the above that the rabbit is, in the first place, a
<b>vertebrate</b> animal; it belongs, secondly, to the <i>mammalian</i>
class of vertebrates, and thirdly, to the <i>rodent</i>-order of mammals.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"> HOW A RABBIT LIVES.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>44. THE SKELETON AND MUSCLES</h4>

<p>1. <b>The examination of the bones.</b>—In a boiled rabbit clear away
the flesh from the bones. Before separating a bone, notice carefully
how it is attached to neighbouring bones. Notice also, especially in
the limbs, the attachment of the bundles of flesh (<i>muscles</i>) to the
bones, the ends of each muscle being fixed to separate bones. Notice
that the places of attachment of the largest muscles are marked by
ridges or roughnesses on the bones.</p>

<p>2. <b>The skull.</b>—Observe the two rounded knobs at the back of
the skull, which fit into hollows on the first bone (vertebra) of the
vertebral column. In the skull notice the saw-like boundaries of the
various bones, and make out: the great, rounded <i>brain-case</i>; the
external openings of the <i>ears</i>; the <i>eye-sockets</i>; the snout, with the
two <i>nasal chambers</i>; and the upper and lower <i>jaws</i>. Before separating
the lower jaw observe carefully how it is hinged on the arches which
run below the eyes, and notice the great muscle on each side which
moves it. Examine the <i>teeth</i> in detail, and remove them one by one
from their sockets. Notice the bony shelf or palate separating the
nasal chambers from the cavity of the mouth. Draw a side view of the
skull.</p>

<p>Shave off the top of the brain-case with a sharp knife, and examine the
<i>brain</i>.</p>

<p>3. <b>The vertebral column.</b>—Make out that each of the bones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
(vertebrae) which compose the vertebral column is really a ring,
and that the whole column is therefore a bony tube. In this tube
is enclosed the spinal cord, a backward continuation of the brain.
Examine and draw vertebrae from the various parts of the column, and
notice how they vary in shape and size. Compare vertebrae from (<i>a</i>)
the neck, (<i>b</i>) the region of the chest (notice the attachment of the
ribs), (<i>c</i>) the abdominal region, (<i>d</i>) the region of the hips (four
united vertebrae; leave these for the present in position between the
hip-bones), (<i>e</i>) the tail.</p>

<p>4. <b>The ribs and sternum.</b>—Examine the manner of attachment of
the anterior (<a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a>) pairs of ribs to the sternum or
breast-bone. Some of the more posterior ribs are free at their ventral ends.</p>

<p>5. <b>The bones of the fore-limb.</b>—Examine the bones in order and
make out: (<i>a</i>) the triangular shoulder-blade, (<i>b</i>) the single long
bone of the upper arm (its upper, rounded end fitting into a socket
in the shoulder-blade; its lower end forming, with the bones of the
fore-arm, the elbow joint), (<i>c</i>) the two bones of the fore-arm (these
lie side by side; notice the peg which makes it impossible for the
hinged elbow-joint to be bent back beyond a straight line), (<i>d</i>) the
small bones of the wrist, (<i>e</i>) the bones of the hand.</p>

<p>6. <b>The bones of the hind-limb.</b>—Notice that the limb as a whole
is divided into parts—upper leg, leg, ankle and foot—which correspond
to the divisions of the fore-limb. Make out: (<i>a</i>) that as the bone of
the upper arm fits into a socket in the shoulder-blade, so the bone
of the upper leg has a ball-shaped end which works in a socket of the
hip-bone. Notice that the two hip-bones are joined together ventrally,
and that they are fixed to the welded vertebrae of the hip-region. Does
this give increased strength to the hind-limb? Identify: (<i>b</i>) the two
bones of the leg (between knee and ankle) and notice that they differ
from the corresponding bones of the arm in being fused together in the
lower part; (<i>c</i>) the bones of the ankle, and (<i>d</i>) the bones
of the foot.</p>

<p>7. <b>The structure of a long bone.</b>—Take the long bones of the
upper arms and upper legs, and examine them further. Break one across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the middle. Is it solid or hollow? What is the advantage of its being
hollow? Is the tube empty or does it contain marrow? Are the ends of
the bone hollow or solid? Place one of the bones on a bright hot fire.
Is there any sign of burning? Does all the bone burn away? Carefully
remove what is left, and compare the brittleness of the “burnt” bone
with that of an unburnt bone. Place another bone for several days in
a cupful of water to which has been added about two teaspoonfuls of
strong hydrochloric acid. Then take it out, wash it; and try to bend
it. Continue the treatment until the bone is soft enough to tie in a
knot. Can you tie an ordinary bone in a knot? Why not? Put a “burnt”
bone in similar dilute acid. Does it dissolve? What do you think gives
a bone its hardness?</p>

<p>8. <b>Bones moved by muscle.</b>—Stretch out one of your arms and
grasp the middle of the upper arm firmly with the other hand. Now
bend the elbow, and notice that the great muscle (the <i>biceps</i>) of
the front of the upper arm thickens and becomes shorter. Straighten
the arm again, and notice that the muscle becomes thinner and longer
again. Examine <a href="#FIG_160">Fig. 160</a>, which shows how the upper end of
the biceps is attached at <i>a</i> to the shoulder-blade and its lower end to one
of the bones of the fore-arm at <i>P</i>. If the biceps muscle shortens, the
fore-arm must be pulled up, because the shoulder remains stationary.</p>

<p>Carefully notice the various movements of which your arm is
capable—<i>e.g.</i> extension of the arm; bending (flexure) on the
elbow-joint; rotation of the fore-arm, so that either the palm or the
back of the hand can be turned upwards; and grasping. Observe your
power of touching the tip of the little finger with that of the thumb.
If a human skeleton is accessible watch how one (which?) of the two
long bones of the fore-arm rotates when the hand is turned over. How
many of these movements can the rabbit make?</p>

<p><b>The uses of the skeleton.</b>—The bodies of vertebrate animals
(<a href="#Page_220">p. 220</a>) are supported, and their more delicate parts protected
from injury, by an internal framework called the skeleton. In some of the
simpler fishes this is composed of gristle or “cartilage”; but in more
highly developed animals it consists almost entirely, in the adult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
state, of bone. Further, almost all the bones are connected with
strands or bundles of red flesh called <b>muscle</b>, which the animal
is able to shorten or “contract” at will. When a muscle shortens, the
bones to which its ends are fixed are of necessity pulled nearer to
each other. If the bone at one end of the muscle remains stationary,
that at the other end is moved into a new position. This is, generally
speaking, the manner in which the numberless movements of the limbs,
head, etc., are made.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_160" id="FIG_160"></a>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 160.</span>—The action of the Biceps muscle.<br />
       <i>a</i>, the attachment of the muscle to the shoulder-blade;<br />
       <i>P</i>, attachment of the muscle to the fore-arm;<br />
       <i>F</i>, elbow;&emsp;<i>W</i>, hand.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The movements of the limbs.</b>—An excellent illustration of this
relation between the bones and muscles is seen in the bending of the
arm at the elbow. When the arm is bent, a great mass of flesh, the
biceps muscle, in front of the upper arm may be observed to become much
thicker. The muscle (<a href="#FIG_160">Fig. 160</a>) thickens because it becomes shorter.
Its upper end is attached to the corner of the shoulder-blade (<i>a</i>), which
remains stationary; while its lower end is connected at <i>P</i> with one of
the bones of the fore-arm. The shortening of the muscle therefore draws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
up the fore-arm. The elbow-joint, about which the motion takes place,
is a very perfect hinge. Several other forms of joint are also found in
various parts of the body. It is seen, when the skeleton is examined,
that in every case the characters of the joints and the attachment of
the muscles are most admirably adapted to the movements with which they
are associated.</p>

<p><b>The study of the skeleton.</b>—The study of the rabbit’s skeleton
is not only highly interesting in itself, but necessary for the
intelligent appreciation of the animal’s life. And when it is compared
with the skeletons of other familiar animals, a common plan of
structure is found which illustrates in the most convincing manner the
kinship which often exists between very dissimilar creatures. Such a
comparison shows that, almost bone for bone, the skeleton of a rabbit
corresponds with that of a man or a horse, and even with that of a bird
or a frog. Mounted skeletons are shown in most natural-history museums,
and the student should, whenever possible, examine and compare
them.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
He can himself, however, easily separate the bones from a boiled
rabbit, and make out their main features and relationships.</p>

<p><b>The rabbit’s skull and backbone</b>—The bones of the head are
collectively known as the <b>skull</b>. This consists of (1) a large
brain case; (2) the cavities for the organs of special sense, viz.,
(<i>a</i>) a pair of nasal chambers (in which the organ of smell is located)
in front: their hinder ends open into the top of the throat; (<i>b</i>) the
eye-sockets at the sides, and (<i>c</i>) the flask-shaped chambers for the
internal ears at the sides of the hinder end of the brain-case; (3)
the jaws: the upper jaw is rigidly attached to the brain-case, but the
lower jaw is hinged at each side on the hinder end of the bony arch
which runs below the eye. Both upper and lower jaws bear teeth, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
are fixed in sockets. On each side the upper jaw contains two incisor
teeth (<a href="#Page_219">p. 219</a>) and—much further back—six grinding teeth.
In the lower jaw are one incisor and five grinding teeth on each side.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

            position, seen from the left side.</p>
</div>

<p>The <b>vertebral column</b> or backbone is a chain of bony rings or
<i>vertebrae</i> which runs dorsally (<a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a>) from the hinder
end of the skull to the tail, and forms a long tube containing the spinal cord—a
backward continuation of the brain. On the anterior face of the first
vertebra are two hollows into which a pair of knobs on the skull fit.
Although, with the exception of the first and second, all the vertebrae
are formed on essentially similar lines, there is considerable
variation in shape and size in the different regions of the spine, as
may be seen from <a href="#FIG_161">Fig. 161</a>. There are seven neck vertebrae,
and this number is remarkably constant in mammals (<a href="#Page_220">p. 220</a>).
Following these are the chest vertebrae, which bear pairs of <b>ribs</b>. The majority
of the ribs curve round and join on to a ventral bar of bone called
the <b>sternum</b> or breast bone; so that the cavity of the chest,
containing those very important organs the heart and lungs, is enclosed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
in a protective bony cage. The vertebrae of the abdominal region of the
body are very large and stout. Between them and the tail-bones are four
fused vertebrae, forming a mass which on each side gives attachment to
the large hip-bone.</p>

<p><b>The bones of the rabbit’s limbs.</b>—The fore and hind-limbs of
the rabbit are obviously comparable: the upper arm corresponding to
the upper leg, the elbow to the knee, the fore-arm to the “leg,” the
wrist to the ankle, and the fore-foot to the hind-foot. This similarity
becomes even more apparent when the limb-skeletons are examined.
Commencing in each limb at the end nearest the body we find a single
long bone. In the fore-limb the rounded, upper end of this bone works
in a socket at the anterior angle of the <b>shoulder-blade</b>, a
triangular plate on each side which overlies the chest dorsally; in
the hind-limb the rounded end of the corresponding bone works in a
cup in the <b>hip-bone</b>. Again, between the elbow and the wrist
are two bones lying side by side; and between the knee and the ankle
are two corresponding bones, although here they are only separate in
their upper parts. Similarly, the wrist bones correspond to the ankle
bones, and the bones of what may be called the fingers to those of
the toes. Certain of the ankle bones are, however, much elongated:
obviously a great advantage to an animal which progresses by a series
of hops—owing to the increased leverage which is thereby given to the
hind-foot. The rabbit’s fore-foot bears five toes, the hind-foot four.</p>

<p><b>The structure of a long bone.</b>—The long bones of the limbs are
hollow except at the ends. Strength and lightness are thus secured by a
device (the hollow cylinder), which has already (<a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a>)
been seen to be adopted by the supporting structures of plants, and is also copied by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
human engineers. The cavity of the tube is filled by marrow, which
supplies the bone with food. The hard, bony tube itself is partly
composed of mineral matter and partly of animal matter. The mineral
matter is left as a white, brittle framework when the animal matter
is burnt away; while on the other hand the mineral part—which gives
the bone its rigidity—may be dissolved out by immersing the bone in
dilute hydrochloric acid, leaving the organic tissue as a soft flexible
substance having the shape of the original bone.</p>

          of thistle funnel.</p>
</div>

<p>1. <b>A solution of starch will not pass through a thin
membrane.</b>—Rub up with water as much starch as will lie on a
shilling, so as to form a thin “cream,” and then pour on it about a
cupful of boiling water. The starch swells up and largely dissolves
in the water. Add a few drops of the starch solution to about half a
pint of water, stir, and test it by adding a little iodine solution
(p.2, <a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">footnote</a>).
A beautiful blue colour is obtained, showing
that the test is a very delicate one. Now take a thistle funnel and with a
file cut through the stem about six inches below the head. Wet a piece
of parchment paper or thin bladder (having previously held it up to
the light to be sure there are no holes in it), and tie it tightly
across the mouth of the funnel. Fill the head and about an inch of the
stem with the starch solution. This can easily be done by means of a
“canula,” such as is used for filling fountain pens. Now put the funnel
into a beaker of water, in the manner shown in <a href="#FIG_162">Fig. 162</a>,
and put the arrangement aside for a few hours. After that time add iodine solution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
to the water in the beaker. No blue colour is formed, showing that no
starch has passed through the membrane.</p>

<p>2. <b>A solution of sugar will pass through a thin membrane.</b>—A
delicate test for certain varieties of sugar (not, however, table sugar)
is a liquid known as Fehling’s solution.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Place a particle of honey in a test tube with a teaspoonful of
Fehling’s solution, and put the test tube into a vessel of boiling
water. Notice that in a short time the blue colour of the solution
disappears and the liquid becomes red and turbid.</p>

<p>Now repeat Experiment <b>45, 1</b>, but instead of starch solution use
honey dissolved in water. To show that some of the honey-sugar has
passed through the membrane, take about a teaspoonful of the water in
the beaker, and put it in a test tube with twice as much Fehling’s
solution. Heat as before, and notice the red turbidity. If table sugar
is used it may be recognised by the sweet taste of the water after the
experiment.</p>

<p>3. <b>The action of saliva on starch.</b>—(<i>a</i>) Chew a piece of
india-rubber to induce a free flow of saliva, and collect the liquid.
In one test tube put half a teaspoonful of starch solution; in a second
tube put a mixture of equal quantities of starch solution and saliva;
in a third put saliva alone. Keep the tubes at blood heat for twenty
minutes. Then add a little water to each tube and divide its contents
into two parts. Test one part of each for starch with iodine solution,
and the other part for sugar with Fehling’s solution. The first tube
contains only starch. The second now contains no starch, but shows
the presence of sugar. The third contains neither starch nor sugar.
<i>Evidently the saliva has changed the starch of the second tube into
sugar.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Repeat the experiment, but keep the mixture of starch and saliva
in a <i>cold</i> place. No sugar is produced.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Repeat the experiment as in (<i>a</i>), but use saliva which has been
heated to boiling in a test tube. No sugar is formed.</p>

<p><b>The necessity for food.</b>—It is common knowledge that a rabbit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
like every other animal, must have a regular supply of food if it is
to continue healthy, and that it would soon die outright if food were
withheld. The reason for this is that the living substance of the
animal’s body is incessantly wasting away. The rabbit cannot move a
muscle except at the expense of the living substance of the muscle,
and the more active is its life, the more rapidly does its body waste.
It is to counteract this continual waste by continual formation of new
living substance that food is taken.</p>

<p>But the succulent plants which the rabbit eats are not suddenly
transformed into animal muscle and bone, and so forth, when they
are swallowed. They have first of all to undergo a process which is
called <b>digestion</b>. This takes place in a tube—the digestive
canal—which runs from end to end of the body. The digestive canal of
the rabbit is coiled in a somewhat intricate manner. That of the frog
is, however, much simpler and more typical of vertebrates (<a href="#Page_220">p. 220</a>)
generally, and will serve equally well in so elementary a consideration
of digestion as the present.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><b>The frog’s digestive canal.</b>—The hinder end of the frog’s mouth
opens (<a href="#FIG_163">Fig. 163</a>) into the <b>gullet</b> (<i>gul.</i>), a short
wide tube which leads to a capacious bag called the <b>stomach</b> (<i>st.</i>). The
termination of this is continuous with a coiled narrow tube called
the <b>small intestine</b> (<i>s. in.</i>), which passes suddenly into a
much wider <b>large intestine</b> or rectum. The rectum opens to the
exterior, at the hinder end of the body, by an aperture (<i>an.</i>) known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
as the anus. In addition to the digestive tube proper, two large
digestive glands, the liver and the pancreas, should be carefully
noticed. The <b>liver</b> (<i>lr.</i>) is a large, dark red organ,
consisting of two lobes which lie at the sides of the stomach. It
makes a digestive fluid called <i>bile</i>. The <b>pancreas</b> (<i>pn.</i>) is
an elongated body which lies in the loop between the stomach and the
first portion—called the <i>duodenum</i> (<i>du.</i>)—of the small intestine.
It makes a digestive fluid called the <i>pancreatic juice</i>. In the frog
both the bile and the pancreatic juice are discharged into the duodenum
by one tube or duct (<i>b.d.</i>). Small digestive glands also occur in the
inner wall of the stomach; these discharge a fluid called <i>gastric
juice</i> into the cavity of the stomach.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The rabbit’s digestive canal</b>—In its main features the digestive
canal of the rabbit resembles that of the frog; here also the mouth
opens into a long tube consisting of gullet, a bag-like stomach, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
small intestine, and a large intestine. There are also a liver
and a pancreas which discharge their fluids—by separate ducts,
however,—into the first part of the small intestine; and the stomach
is supplied with gastric juice by small glands in its inner wall.
There are, however, certain differences besides those of size in the
digestive tubes of the two animals. In the first place, a fluid called
<i>saliva</i> is poured into the rabbit’s mouth by the ducts of salivary
glands which occur near the mouth. Secondly, the coils of the small
intestine are very much more complicated than in the frog. And lastly,
at the junction of small and large intestines there is given off, in
the rabbit and in herbivorous mammals generally (when these have simple
stomachs,—<a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>), a great, spirally-constricted
tube which ends blindly in a finger-like process.</p>

<p><b>How the rabbit digests its food.</b>—A rabbit needs food to
repair the constant waste of substance which the activities of its
life entail; and the same is true of every other living thing, be it
plant or animal. Now, every part of a rabbit’s body is irrigated and
drained by the finest branches of a system of pipes through which
blood is always flowing; and it is in this blood-stream that the food
is conveyed to the muscles and other organs which are to be repaired.
The food finds its way into the blood when that fluid is flowing
through the small vessels which lie in the thickness of the wall of
the digestive tube. Before food can gain access to the blood it must
be in a condition in which it is capable of diffusing through the
thin membrane which separates them. <b>Digestion is the process which
renders food soluble and diffusible</b>, and hence capable of passing
into the blood. The food of animals is of several different kinds. A
few of these are soluble and diffusible at the time they are eaten, but
most of them are neither, and therefore require treating according to
their nature. This is why so many different fluids are poured into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
rabbit’s digestive canal. Saliva, gastric juice, bile, and pancreatic
juice are each capable of acting upon certain constituents of the food
and rendering them soluble and diffusible.</p>

<p>It would be beyond the scope of this book to consider the work of these
fluids in detail, but the <b>action of saliva</b> is not only fairly
typical, but it can easily be imitated outside the body. <b>Starch</b>
is a very common constituent of vegetable foods, and its presence or
absence is readily determined by the blue colour which it gives with a
solution of iodine. Starch is quite insoluble in cold water, but when
treated with hot water it swells up and, to a great extent, dissolves.
But a mere solution of starch cannot get into the blood, for it is
incapable (Expt. <b>45, 1</b>) of passing through a thin membrane. On
the other hand, if starch is mixed with saliva, and the mixture is
kept at the temperature of the body, it is found in a short time that
the starch has been changed into sugar, which is not only soluble, but
readily diffuses through a thin membrane. In other words, starch <i>as
such</i> is useless to the rabbit as food; only after it has been digested
by conversion into sugar can it be used by the body.</p>

<p>Something very similar often takes place in plants. It was seen (<a href="#Page_33">p. 33</a>)
that the cotyledons of a pea become sweet during germination. Starch
is a convenient form of food for storing in the cotyledons of a pea,
the endosperm of the maize seed, the short stem of the crocus-corm,
and so on; but before the plant can use it as food the starch must be
made soluble and diffusible by being changed into sugar. In plants the
change is brought about, not by saliva, but by a substance known as
<i>diastase</i>.</p>

<p>The pancreatic juice continues the change of starch into sugar which is
commenced by the saliva, but it also digests other food-stuffs as well.
Similarly, gastric juice and bile are each concerned with the digestion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of certain foods. The result of the action—separate and combined—of
the digestive fluids is that, when a rabbit eats no more food than it
requires, all the useful parts of the food are absorbed into the blood,
and then distributed to the tissues by the blood as it flows through them.</p>

<h4>46. THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Evidence of the circulation.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>The arterial
pulse.</i>—Feel your pulse at the wrist and count the number of beats per
minute.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The beats of the heart.</i>—Similarly count how many times your
heart beats per minute. Put your ear over the heart of a friend, and
listen to the sounds of the heart. How many different sounds can you
distinguish?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The valves of the veins.</i>—Press your thumb on your arm inside
the elbow, and then move it down the arm towards the wrist. Notice the
small knots which rise under the skin between the point of pressure and
the wrist.</p>

<p>2. <b>The structure of a sheep’s heart.</b><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>—Procure
from the butcher a sheep’s heart with, if possible, the lungs still attached.
If the thin transparent bag which naturally surrounds the heart has been
left on, carefully cut it away. Make out the main external features
of the heart before cutting into it. The shape is conical, the apex
of the cone being posterior, the base (where the blood-vessels are
attached) anterior. The ventral face is rounded; the dorsal face is
flatter. Compare <a href="#FIG_164">Fig. 164</a>. The line of fat (<i>3</i>) marks the
line of division between two chambers, the right (<i>R.V.</i>) and left (<i>L.V.</i>)
<i>ventricles</i>. Feel that the right ventricle yields to pressure
more readily than the left. Two more chambers, the right and left
<i>auricles</i>, are situated at the basal (thick) end. <i>R.A.</i> and <i>L.A.</i>
are flaps of the right and left auricles respectively. Identify the
great vessels <i>SVC</i> and <i>IVC</i> which discharge into the right auricle.
Cut them open to see the entrance. Then lay open the right auricle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Pass your finger down and notice that the right auricle communicates
freely with the right ventricle. Observe that you can from the right
ventricle pass your finger into the tube <i>P.A.</i>; make out that this
goes to the lungs. Lay open the left auricle, and see that it receives
vessels <i>from</i> the lungs. Pass your finger from the left auricle into
the left ventricle, and notice that this latter chamber leads into the
<i>Aorta</i>, <i>Ao.</i> (<i>A´o´.</i> a branch of <i>Ao.</i>). Notice that the walls of
the blood-vessels in connection with the two auricles are collapsed,
while those (<i>P.A.</i> and <i>Ao.</i>) leading from the two ventricles are more
elastic and remain open. Which of the two auricles has the thicker
wall? Which of the two ventricles has the thicker wall? Can you pass
your finger from one auricle to the other? From one ventricle to the
other? Cut away the auricles and pour water into the ventricles. Then
squeeze the heart gently, and notice the flaps which rise to close the
openings into the ventricles. Could blood pass from the ventricles to
the auricles? Why not? Lay open the bases of the vessels <i>P.A.</i> and
<i>Ao.</i> leading from the right and left ventricles respectively, and
notice the pockets of thin membrane which are attached there. Open them
out gently with the point of a pencil. Put the heart under the tap and
let water trickle down the vessels towards the ventricles; notice how
the pockets stand out as they fill with water. What would be the effect
of blood trying to pass from <i>P.A.</i> or <i>Ao.</i> back into their respective
ventricles?</p>

<p><b>The circulation of the blood.</b>—The blood of such an animal
as the rabbit is contained in a system of closed tubes called
blood-vessels, through which the fluid is continually flowing. The
regular flow of the blood in one direction is maintained by the
action of the <b>heart</b>, a four-chambered organ which is situated
in the chest, between the lungs. The heart is muscular, and, like
other muscles (<a href="#Page_225">p. 225</a>), has the power of “contracting”
in definite directions. The contraction of the walls of the chambers of the heart
lessens their capacity, and therefore drives the blood out of them, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
direction of flow being determined by valves. The vessels which carry
blood <i>to</i> the heart are called <b>veins</b>; those which transmit the
blood which is pumped <i>out of</i> the heart are called <b>arteries</b>.
The arteries branch into smaller and smaller tubes which supply the
various organs of the body, and the small arterial branches divide
again and again in the organs until their finest ramifications form a
close-meshed network of vessels with excessively thin walls, through
which diffusion can readily take place between the tissues and the
blood. These finest blood-vessels are called <b>capillaries</b>. They
can be studied in the transparent web of the frog’s foot with the aid
of a low power of the microscope. The blood can then be seen flowing,
at a speed which varies with the size of the vessel, its course being
rendered obvious by the tiny oval particles (red corpuscles) which
are suspended in it. The smallest capillaries are so thin-walled that
they appear to be merely channels in the substance of the web, and the
corpuscles creep along in single file. But these channels unite to form
larger vessels with obvious walls, and these unite again and again
until a main vein is formed in which the blood, with its suspended
corpuscles, rushes along in a swift torrent towards the heart.</p>

<p><b>The heart.</b>—The beginner will find the sheep’s heart more
convenient for examination than the rabbit’s, on account of its larger
size; but apart from some difference in the arrangement of the great
blood-vessels opening into them, the two hearts are broadly similar.</p>

<p>The heart (<a href="#FIG_164">Fig. 164</a>) consists of four chambers. Two of
these, the <b>auricles</b>, are receiving-chambers, and are placed at the thick,
anterior end of the heart. Into the right auricle open the great veins
(<i>SVC</i>, <i>IVC</i>,) which bring blood from all parts of the body except
the lungs; the left auricle receives only blood from the lungs. Each
auricle opens into a more posterior chamber called a <b>ventricle</b>,
the right auricle opening into the right ventricle and the left auricle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
into the left ventricle. The ventricles pump blood into the arteries.
The blood from the right ventricle is sent into the artery (<i>P.A.</i>)
which supplies the capillaries of the lungs; while the blood of the
left ventricle is forced into the aorta (<i>Ao.</i>), a great artery which
branches and supplies with blood all parts of the body except the
lungs. The two auricles contract simultaneously, forcing their contents
into the flaccid ventricles. Then both the filled ventricles contract
at once, and pump blood into the great arteries, flaps of membrane
between the auricles and ventricles preventing a backward flow into the
auricles. Similarly the bases of the great arteries are provided with
membranous pockets which readily admit the blood from the ventricles
when these contract, but entirely prevent a return of blood to the
ventricles. The appearance of these four sets of valves, as seen
from above, is shown in <a href="#FIG_165">Fig. 165</a>. After the contraction
of the two ventricles there is a short rest, then the auricles contract again
and the whole process is repeated.</p>

<p>The <b>sounds</b> which are heard when the ear is placed over another
person’s heart are often compared to the syllables <i>lub-dup</i>. The
“lub” is partly caused by the contraction of the ventricles; the
“dup,” which immediately follows, is caused by the sudden closure of
the valves at the bases of the great arteries. The throb of the heart,
which can be felt from the outside, is really the thrust of the apex
of the heart against the chest-wall at each beat. The sudden forcing
of blood into the already-full but elastic arteries causes a wave to
travel along these vessels, which can readily be felt, or even seen,
at places where a fairly large artery lies just beneath the skin.
This arterial wave is called the <b>pulse</b>. Many of the veins are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
provided with pouch-shaped valves which permit the blood to flow freely
towards the heart, but which bar the passage of blood in the opposite
direction. Their action will readily be understood from
Figs. <a href="#FIG_166"> 166</a> and <a href="#FIG_167"> 167</a>.</p>

<p><b>The importance of the capillaries.</b>—The capillaries are the
least conspicuous part of the circulatory system, but they are by far
the most important. The heart, arteries, and veins exist merely to
renew constantly the blood which flows through these minute channels.
The excessive thinness of the walls of the capillaries makes it
possible for a ready exchange to take place between the living tissue
and the blood, and the vessels themselves form a network of such
extremely close texture that it is practically impossible to prick
any living part of the body with a fine needle without puncturing
some of them and “drawing blood.” The work of the blood in supplying
the various organs of the body with food has already been referred
to. We have next to see how this all-important fluid is of service in
supplying the organs with oxygen.</p>

<h4>47. RESPIRATION.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Carbon dioxide is formed when flesh burns.</b>—Dry a piece of
meat and attach it to the end of a wire. Then light it, and when it
is burning vigorously lower it into a clean glass jar. When the flame
goes out remove the charred flesh, and at once pour a little clear
lime-water into the jar and shake up. The lime-water turns milky,
showing the presence of carbon dioxide gas in the jar. Examine what is
left of the meat. It is charred, showing that meat contains carbon. How
was the carbon dioxide formed during the burning?</p>

<p>2. <b>Carbon dioxide is formed by the living body.</b>—Breathe through
a glass tube into clear lime-water, so that the air you expel from your
lungs bubbles through the liquid. Does the lime-water remain clear,
or turn milky? Does the air you breathe out contain a considerable
quantity of carbon dioxide gas?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Burning and life.</b>—When a piece of the flesh of any animal has
been dried it may easily be set on fire. The burning is caused by the
union of the constituents of the flesh with some of the oxygen of the
air to form various gases. One of these gases is carbon dioxide, formed
by the combination of the carbon of the flesh with oxygen. Carbon is
present in all the parts of animals and plants, as is evident from
the separation of charcoal (an impure form of carbon) in the first
stages of burning; the carbon dioxide gas which is formed may easily be
recognised by the milkiness which it produces in clear lime-water. The
liberation of heat, and the formation of carbon dioxide, which always
accompany the burning of animal and plant tissues, are worthy of very
careful attention.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 168.</span>—Experiment to prove that<br />
           expired air contains carbon dioxide.</p>
</div>

<p>It is well known that the body of a living animal such as a rabbit
or a man is always <i>warm</i>; and the experiment (<a href="#FIG_168">Fig. 168</a>)
of passing through clear lime-water the air breathed out from the lungs shows,
by the milkiness produced, that the animal is also constantly producing
carbon dioxide during its life. Is life, then, always accompanied
by a peculiar form of burning, in which the living substance of the
body is the combustible material? It seems so, and the experiments of
physiologists tend to confirm this view.</p>

<p><b>The necessity for breathing.</b>—The energy which enables a muscle
to contract is derived from the oxidation—the slow burning—of part of
its substance, just as the energy which enables a steam-engine to move
is derived from the burning of fuel in the boiler fires. The fires soon
go out, and the engine stops, unless fresh fuel is added from time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
time and a plentiful supply of air is available. Similarly, a
muscle loses its power of contracting, a gland that of secreting,
the brain that of thinking, unless the waste matters resulting from
previous activities are cleared away and replaced by fresh food and
fresh oxygen. Wherever vital action is taking place, whether in a
contracting muscle, a secreting gland, or a thinking brain, there is
continual consumption of oxygen and continual production of waste
material, chiefly carbon dioxide. In the higher animals the renewal of
oxygen and the removal of waste material are performed by the blood.
Blood-vessels are to the body what rivers and canals are to a country:
they act as highways for the transport of material. We may perhaps
carry the analogy a little farther and find in the red corpuscles of
the blood the rough equivalents of boats or canal-barges, for they
carry with them tiny loads of oxygen. As the blood creeps along the
narrow channels in an active tissue the red corpuscles relinquish their
oxygen, and the fluid portion of the blood takes up carbon dioxide.
The blood continues its course, and sooner or later arrives at a place
where it can obtain a fresh supply of oxygen and get rid of its surplus
carbon dioxide. In the rabbit this exchange takes place as the blood is
passing through the capillaries of the <b>lungs</b>. There the blood
is separated from the air by a membrane so delicate that gases can
readily pass through it; and, hence, on leaving the lungs the blood has
got rid of the waste carbon dioxide, and its red corpuscles are laden
with fresh oxygen. <i>This exchange of useless carbon dioxide for oxygen
constitutes respiration or breathing.</i></p>

<p><b>The mechanism of respiration.</b>—In active animals the air inside
the lungs soon becomes vitiated, unless there is some means of changing
it. Under ordinary conditions a man changes the air in his lungs from
thirteen to fifteen times a minute. He does this quite automatically,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
and without thinking about it. Every four seconds or so a set of
muscles contracts and pulls his ribs upwards and outwards; another
muscular contraction pulls down the floor of his chest at the same
time. As a consequence the cavity is much enlarged. The lungs follow
the movements of the walls of the chest, and some thirty cubic inches
of air are sucked in. Immediately the ribs fall back to their former
position, the chest-floor rises, and air is driven out. Then after a
short pause the process is repeated. It should be noticed that only
about thirty cubic inches of air are changed at each respiration,
although the capacity of the human lungs averages about 230 cubic
inches. All mammals breathe in much the same way.</p>

<p><b>Plants and animals.</b>—There are considerably more points of
similarity than of difference between plants and animals. In every
case the vital activities are accompanied by an oxidation of living
substance, and from this fact arises the necessity for food and oxygen.
The breathing of plants is essentially like that of animals, and
consists in taking in oxygen and giving out carbon dioxide; though
the <i>mechanism</i> of respiration is—except in the lowest plants and
animals—entirely different in the two cases. It is in the sources from
which they obtain their <b>food</b> that plants and animals are most
unlike. An animal must be supplied with food which has already been
prepared by some other living thing; and it is obvious that the food
even of carnivorous animals can ultimately be traced back to plants,
for the flesh-eater preys upon the vegetarian. Animals are therefore
entirely dependent upon plants for food. In this sense the saying “all
flesh is grass” is full of significance.</p>

<p>Green plants (<a href="#Page_26">Chapter II.</a>) are quite independent of
all other forms of life, and can build up their substance from water, mineral matter,
and the carbon dioxide of the air. The taking in of carbon dioxide and
giving out of oxygen by green plants has nothing whatever to do with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
respiration; it is part of their process of feeding. Green plants
breathe in the usual manner—by taking in oxygen and giving out
carbon dioxide. It should, however, be noticed that the peculiar
method by which a green plant obtains its carbonaceous food is of the
highest importance to animal life; for by this process the amount of
injurious carbon dioxide in the air is considerably lessened, while the
proportion of life-supporting oxygen in it is greatly increased.</p>

<p>Fungi (<a href="#Page_199">Chapter XI.</a>) seem to be intermediate, as regards
their method of feeding, between green plants and animals. They require their
carbonaceous food in an organic form, that is, already prepared by
other living things; but they can obtain the other elements of their
food from mineral salts and water.</p>

<p>The thoughtful student will be increasingly impressed by the extent to
which the plant and animal kingdoms are dependent upon each other, and
by the manner in which each utilises the waste products of the other
for carrying on its own life processes.</p>

<h4>48. THE CAT AND DOG.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The external characters of the cat.</b>—Carefully and gently
examine a cat, and make notes of the following characters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Hair.</i>—What is the covering of the body like? Is the hair
like that of a rabbit, <i>i.e.</i> fur (<a href="#Page_216">p. 216</a>)? Are the
whiskers very noticeable? On what parts of the head do they grow? Are the fur and
large whiskers in any way connected with the animal’s habits?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Eyes.</i>—Look at a cat’s eyes in a bright light. Is the pupil (p.
212) round or slit-like? Keep the cat in the dark for a few minutes and
then look again at the pupil of the eye; has it changed in form? Is the
change of any advantage to the cat?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Teeth.</i>—Gently open the cat’s mouth and examine the teeth.
Notice the sharp, pointed teeth behind the incisors (<a href="#Page_219">p. 219</a>);
they are called the <i>canine</i> teeth. Has a rabbit any canine teeth? Why does a
cat, and not a rabbit, need such teeth? Feel the remaining teeth with
your finger; are they flat like those of a rabbit, or sharp-edged? How
are the characters of the teeth associated with the kind of food? Watch
a cat eating; does it chew its food or swallow it “in lumps”?</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Tongue.</i>—Pass your finger-end over the cat’s tongue; is it
rough or smooth? In which direction of motion of the finger does the
tongue feel roughest? Would the roughness be of any help to the animal
in licking meat from bones?</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The limbs.</i>—Measure the legs. Are the fore and hind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
limbs of equal length, slightly unequal, or very unequal? How do they
compare in this respect with the limbs of the rabbit? Make out the
main bones by feeling through the skin, and especially notice where
the ankle-joint is. Examine the toes and notice how, when you gently
squeeze them just behind the ends, the sharp <i>claws</i> protrude, and go
back into a kind of sheath when the pressure is removed. Can the animal
put out its claws and draw them back at will?</p>
</div>

<p>2. <b>The habits of the cat.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Food.</i>—What kind of food does
the cat prefer, animal or vegetable? Does it bolt its food greedily, or
does it eat deliberately and daintily? Have you ever known cats to hunt
other animals? Do they hunt singly, or do several cats join together
to hunt? How do they approach the prey; do they try to run it down by
speed, or do they creep up slyly and then spring? What is the use of
the claws? How does a cat drink?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Locomotion.</i>—Watch a cat moving slowly; does it walk or hop?
Try to find out the order in which it puts its feet down. How does it
run? Is it nimble or clumsy? Does the cat walk with the whole sole of
its foot on the ground, or does it walk “on its toes”?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Likes and dislikes.</i>—Do you consider a cat sociable, <i>i.e.</i>
fond, in general, of the society of other cats? Do cats, as a rule,
show much appreciation of the difference between right and wrong? Are
they as affectionate as dogs? Have you ever heard of any cat trying to
remain in a house after the family had removed to another house? Are
cats fonder of warm or of cool places in a house? Do they like getting
wet? Do they pay much attention to personal cleanliness? How do they
wash themselves? Do you think the tongue is used as a comb? How? Can
you know whether a cat is pleased or angry (i) by the appearance and
movements of the tail, (ii) by the sounds which it makes?</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Intelligence.</i>—Write accounts of cases of great intelligence
which you have known cats to show.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Voice.</i>—How do you describe a cat’s voice? How does the voice
vary according to the animal’s mood?</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Play.</i>—How does a cat play?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
3. <b>Kittens.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Appearance.</i>—Are kittens helpless or active
when they are born? Is there any very marked difference between the
proportions of the body and limbs and those of a full-grown cat? At
what age is a cat full-grown?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Play.</i>—How does a kitten play? How does it pretend to “stalk” a
small object, such as a ball of wool? In the same way that a full-grown
cat stalks a mouse? Why does the kitten adopt this method before it has
any experience of hunting?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Education.</i>—Watch a cat with its kittens, and describe any
actions which seem like education. Have you ever seen a cat teach its kittens
to fight? Have you ever seen it punish a kitten for disobeying a call?</p>

<p>4. <b>The external characters of the dog.</b>—Examine a dog in the
same way, and compare it point by point with the cat as regards the
following characters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Hair.</i>—Notice that the dog is covered, not with fur, but with
rough hair, and that the whiskers are not very large. How are these
differences associated with differences in habit?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Eyes.</i>—Notice that the pupil is always round, although it is
smaller in a strong light than in a weak one.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Teeth.</i>—Compare the teeth with those of the cat, and notice
that they are of similar form—with strong interlocking canines and a
sharp-edged tooth on each side of the upper jaw which clips against
a similar tooth in the lower jaw—but that the cat’s teeth are more
pointed.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Tongue.</i>—Notice that the dog’s tongue is much smoother than the
cat’s.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Limbs.</i>—Examine and measure the limbs, comparing them with
those of the cat, rabbit, and man. Notice that the claws are blunter
than the cat’s, and that they cannot be withdrawn into sheaths. How
many toes are there on the feet?</p>
</div>

<p>5. <b>The habits of the dog.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Food.</i>—Does the dog prefer
animal or vegetable food? Watch a dog gnawing a bone, and observe the
use of the clipping teeth. Does a dog eat greedily or deliberately?
Does it chew its food or swallow it in lumps? Do dogs hunt singly or in
packs? Do they stalk the prey stealthily, as cats do, or do they try to
run it down by speed? Whenever possible watch a pack of hounds; upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
what sense—hearing, sight, or smell—do the hounds rely most? How does
a dog drink?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Locomotion.</i>—Does a slowly-moving dog hop or walk? Try to find
out the order in which it puts its feet down. How does it run? Does a
dog walk flat-footed or on its toes?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Likes and dislikes.</i>—Do you consider dogs sociable or
otherwise? Do they seem to know the difference between right and wrong?
Are dogs affectionate? Are they more attached to the people or to the
houses to which they are accustomed? What can you learn of a dog’s
feelings, by the movements of its tail? Write accounts of instances,
which you know to be true, illustrating its likes and dislikes. What
expression of the human face seems to you most like the snarl of an
angry dog? What are the resemblances?</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Intelligence.</i>—Write accounts of evidence of intelligence, or
reasoning power, which you have observed in dogs.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Voice.</i>—What is the ordinary voice of the dog? What other
sounds do dogs make, and what do they mean?</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Play.</i>—How do dogs play? Do you think dogs have any sense of
humour, or are able to appreciate a joke for the joke’s sake? Have you
ever seen any expression resembling a smile on a dog’s face?</p>

<p>6. <b>Puppies.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Appearance.</i>—Are puppies blind and helpless
when they are born, or are they active? How soon can they see? Are the
proportions of the body and limbs markedly different from those of the
full-grown dog? At what age is a dog full-grown?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Play.</i>—Does a puppy play in the same manner as a kitten? What
differences have you noticed? Have these differences any connection
with the methods of catching the prey of the adult animals?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Education.</i>—Have you ever seen a puppy being taught to do
anything by its mother? Write full accounts of such cases.</p>

<p>7. <b>Different breeds of dogs.</b>—Make notes of your observations of
as many different breeds of dogs as possible, <i>e.g.</i> collies, terriers,
retriever, fox-hound, pointer, spaniel, etc., and describe the
resemblances and differences in size, form, habits, intelligence, etc.

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 169.</span>—The Cat.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The external characters of the cat and dog.</b>—The cat and the dog
are so commonly kept as pets that they are perhaps more easily examined
than any other animals. In addition, they are so closely related and
yet exhibit so many differences that they afford a valuable exercise
in the methods of <b>comparison and contrast</b> which are at the
foundation of all successful work in Nature-Study. Several differences
are at once apparent on even a casual inspection. The body of the
<b>cat</b> (<a href="#FIG_169">Fig. 169</a>) is covered with soft, smooth <i>fur</i>,
and its head is provided with long, sensitive whiskers. In both of these respects
it resembles the rabbit and other mammals which are in the habit of
creeping along narrow and dark passages. It is commonly said that
cats can see in the dark. Although this is not altogether true—for
no animal can see in total darkness—the cat’s eyes have the power of
adapting themselves remarkably to the intensity of the light. In a
dim light, the curtain, or iris, which surrounds the pupil (the dark,
central window through which light enters the eye) is drawn back so as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
to admit as much light as possible; whereas in a very bright light the
curtain is so nearly closed that the pupil is merely a narrow, vertical
slit. On the other hand, the <b>dog</b> (<a href="#FIG_170">Fig. 170</a>), which
is not fond of dark passages, has its body clothed with <i>rough hair</i>,
instead of fur; and its whiskers are not nearly so long as those of the cat.
Again, although the iris of a dog’s eye alters in size to regulate
the amount of light entering the eye, the pupil is always round, and
the change of size is much less marked than in the cat. Another very
noticeable difference is in the <b>claws</b> at the ends of the toes,
corresponding to the nails at the ends of our own fingers and toes.
In the cat these are sickle-shaped and extremely sharp, and are kept
drawn completely back into sheaths when they are not required. The
dog’s claws are blunt, and cannot be retracted. Both the dog and the
cat rest the weight of the body upon the toes—not upon the sole of the
foot—when walking or running.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_170" id="FIG_170"></a>
    <img src="images/i_251.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="419" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 170.</span>—Foxhound.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
There is also a very marked difference in the <b>tongues</b> of the two
animals. The tongue of the cat is rough, with small points directed
backwards. These points are of great help in licking the flesh from
bones; and they also serve as a comb when the cat—which is fastidious
about the cleanliness of its fur—“washes” itself. The tongue of the
dog is smooth and moist.</p>

<p><b>The inherited habits of the cat and dog.</b>—Very obvious
differences are also to be seen in the habits of the two animals,
and these would be somewhat difficult to explain if we confined our
attention to the domesticated animals only, which live under artificial
conditions. When, however, we consider the wild relatives of the cat
and dog, many of the differences become full of significance. The
wild animals of the cat family, almost without exception, are either
solitary or live in pairs; whereas the wild dogs (wolves, jackals,
etc.) live in packs. The habits which these respective methods of life
entailed have become so firmly implanted in the nature of the race
that even now, after thousands of generations of domestication, they
may be traced. Such inherited habits, which are not dependent upon,
or may be at variance with, present conditions of life, are called
<b>instincts</b>.</p>

<p>We will first see how the ancestral custom of living in organised packs
has left its impress upon the instincts of the domesticated dog. The
first essential to the success of any community of animals—whether
these are bees or rooks, wolves or men—is that all the creatures
composing it shall conform to certain rules, which have for their
object the good of the community and not merely that of the individual.
Acts which promote the wellbeing of the society as a whole are good,
and are directly or indirectly rewarded. Acts which tend to injure the
society as such are bad, and inevitably bring punishment either to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
individual offender or, what is worse, to his pack. A distinction
between right and wrong is thus established which would be impossible
to any animal living so solitary a life that its acts affected only
itself. In this manner were aroused the social instinct, the love
of praise and the dread of shame, the lifelong attachment to early
friends, and almost all the other qualities which have so endeared the
dog to mankind; because these qualities resulted naturally from the
ancestral pack-life. Left to itself, the dog loses its nerve, for it is
by nature unfitted for a solitary life. What more woe-begone animal is
ever seen than a lost dog?</p>

<p>Contrast the cat in these respects. It is at heart an outlaw, like its
wild ancestors: recognising, in general, no motives but those of its
own ease and gratification. Its social instinct is almost absent; and
though it sometimes displays affection to people who pet it, the cat
is, as a rule, more attached to places than to persons. It retains,
too, the independence and versatility which are developed by a solitary
life. A lost cat can usually take care of itself and find sufficient
food; and cases are not uncommon of cats leaving comfortable homes and
choosing to live wild lives in the woods.</p>

<p>Ancestral methods of <b>hunting</b> also account largely for certain
differences in the domestic cat and dog. The solitary ancestral cats,
like the lions and tigers of to-day, sprang suddenly upon the prey at
the end of silent, stealthy stalking. How firmly this method has become
fixed in the character of the race may be seen still in the manner in
which a cat stalks a mouse or a small bird, or even, in play, a dead
leaf. At the final spring the sharp, sickle-shaped claws are used to
hold down the victim. The solitary hunter is able to devour its capture
at leisure, and the domestic cat is still distinguished by its dainty
and deliberate manner of feeding.</p>

<p>The wild dogs hunt in a quite different manner. The whole pack joins in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the chase, the trail being followed by the sense of smell. There is no
attempt at concealment, no stealthy stalking; but an open reliance upon
speed, endurance, and numbers, rather than upon cunning. If one dog
loses the scent another picks it up and gives the signal. Mutual help
is thus the secret of success in hunting. But this is at an end when
the prey is killed. The victim is torn to pieces and devoured greedily,
each animal eating as rapidly as possible, for in most cases there is
not enough to satisfy them all. And the well-fed domestic dog still
betrays the ancestral necessity for hurried eating in the manner of
bolting his food.</p>

<p><b>Methods of expressing feeling.</b>—Animals express their feelings
in various ways—by the voice, by the face, by the tail, and by the
general attitude of the body. Perhaps no animal’s feelings are more
readily recognised by man than the dog’s. “It is a remarkable fact,”
says Darwin,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
“that the dog, since being domesticated, has learnt to bark in at least
four or five distinct tones. Although barking is a new art, no doubt
the wild parent-species of the dog expressed their feelings by cries of
various kinds. With the domesticated dog we have the bark of eagerness,
as in the chase; that of anger, as well as growling; the yelp or howl
of despair, as when shut up; the baying at night; the bark of joy, as
when starting on a walk with his master; and the very distinct one
of demand or supplication, as when wishing for a door or window to
be opened.” The movements of the tail are also full of meaning, and
capable of expressing several different moods. It seems likely that
in a dog the movements of the tail were originally of use chiefly to
signal to the rest of the pack. The use of the movements of a cat’s
tail is not very clear, although these also differ according to the
animal’s feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
<b>Carnivores.</b>—Dogs and cats, with several other mammals, which
are mostly flesh-eaters, are called <b>Carnivores</b>. They have never
fewer than four distinct toes on each foot, and the claws (nails) are
often capable of being withdrawn into sheaths. The teeth (<a href="#FIG_171">Fig. 171</a>)
are characterised by the large, interlocking canines, which are conical,
curved, and pointed; and by one of the cheek teeth on each side having
a sharp, cutting edge which bites against the similar tooth of the
other jaw, almost in the manner of the blades of scissors. The seals
and walruses, however, which are carnivores adapted to living in water,
have no such clipping teeth.</p>

<h4>49. THE BAT.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Habits.</b>—At what time of the year have you seen bats flying
about? Do they fly in broad daylight, or only in the evening? How can
you distinguish a bat’s flight from that of a bird? Have you ever heard
a bat squeak? Upon what does it feed? Are flying insects plentiful in
winter? Have you ever seen a bat drink? How does it drink? What does
the bat do in winter? Try to find a sleeping bat in winter in a barn, a
hollow tree, or a belfry. What is its position?</p>

<p>2. <b>Appearance.</b>—Examine a sleeping bat or a stuffed specimen.
What is its body covered with, hair or feathers? Is it a bird or a
mammal? Is the hair soft and furry? How large are the ears? Are the
whiskers large or small? What are the wings like? Can you see any
fingers? How many fingers are there? Do any of the fingers bear claws?
Do the fingers support the wings? Which are longer, the fore limbs or
the hind limbs? Do the toes of the hind limbs bear claws? What is their
use? If possible, put a live bat on the ground; does it walk easily?
Apart from the wings, what animal does the bat seem most to resemble?
Do you know of any other flying mammal?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Bat</b> (Figs. <a href="#FIG_172">172</a> and
<a href="#FIG_184A">184 <i>a</i></a>).—On summer evenings in most
country districts of Britain bats may be seen flitting about catching
insects. The flight is peculiar, and somewhat suggestive of that of a
butterfly, so that even in the dusk the animal may be distinguished
easily from a small bird. “Bats drink on the wing like swallows, by
sipping the surface as they play over pools and streams. They love to
frequent waters, not only for the sake of drinking, but on account of
insects, which are found over them in the greatest plenty.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_172" id="FIG_172"></a>
    <img src="images/i_256.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="218" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 172.</span>—The Bat. (×&nbsp;⅓.)</p>
</div>

<p>The voice of the bat is a shrill squeak, of so high a pitch that many
people cannot hear it at all. The animal is probably quite blind, but
it has keen powers of scent and hearing, and in avoiding obstacles
seems to be greatly aided by patches of specially sensitive skin on the
face, and by delicate whiskers. During the day it lurks in dark corners
of barns, church-towers, hollow trees, etc., hanging head downward by
the hooked claws of its hind feet.</p>

<p>On close examination the body of the bat is seen to be covered with
soft <b>fur</b>, a character which at once proclaims the animal to be
not a bird—as it has been incorrectly considered—but a <b>mammal</b>.
The fur is often of a bright chestnut colour. The ears are large
and practically devoid of hair, and are so thin as to be almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
transparent. The wings are thin folds of skin, which are attached in
front to the long arms, are supported by the greatly elongated fingers,
and reach to the hind limbs. Another membrane passes between the hind
limbs, and in common species is also supported by the tail. The thumb
is free, and bears a claw which is of some assistance in climbing. The
hind limbs are small.</p>

<p>The structure of the bat is obviously but little adapted to walking,
and the animal moves about very awkwardly when on the ground, although
it can rise on the wing again without much difficulty.</p>

<p>The bat is rarely to be seen abroad after the middle of November, for
as the cold weather approaches and insects become scarce, it suspends
itself by its hind claws in some dark and sheltered corner, and goes to
sleep for the winter, reappearing in early spring.</p>

<h4>50. HOOFED MAMMALS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The external characters of the sheep.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Wool.</i>—How
does the covering of a sheep’s body differ from the fur of a cat or
rabbit, and from the hair of the dog? Examine a lock of “raw” wool; is
it at all greasy? Dip it in water; is it much wetted? Are the fibres
easily entangled together? Why is woollen clothing so warm?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Teeth.</i>—Obtain a sheep’s head from the butcher, and examine the
teeth. Notice the absence of incisors and canines in the upper jaw, and
of canines in the lower jaw. Observe the thickened pad on the surface
of the upper jaw, against which the lower incisors bite. Are the cheek
teeth flat, or sharp-edged like the cheek teeth of carnivores? Watch a
sheep feeding, and notice how it bites the grass. How is the lower jaw
moved during the chewing of the cud?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Horns.</i>—Which sheep have the largest horns, the males (rams) or
the females (ewes)? If you can find a cast horn notice whether it is
hollow or solid. What is the use of horns?</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Limbs.</i>—Is there any marked difference in the lengths of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
fore and hind limbs? Notice the <i>hoofs</i> which cover those parts of the
feet touching the ground. How many hoofs are there on each foot?</p>

<p>2. <b>The habits of the sheep.</b>—Are sheep solitary or do they live
in flocks? What kind of ground do they seem to prefer, flat or hilly?
Are sheep on a hillside easily seen from a distance? Why not? Are sheep
nimble or clumsy? Can they run very fast? Would a flock of sheep be
safer from, say, wolves on a rocky hillside or on an open plain? In a
grazing flock of sheep notice whether most of the animals have their
heads turned in the same direction. Has the direction any relation to
the direction of the wind? Can you explain this?</p>

<p>In a running flock of sheep does any one animal act as leader? Is the
leader a ram or a ewe? Is it a lamb or an old animal? Do the rest of
the flock imitate the actions of the leader, and, for example, leap
over a wall at the same place in single file? Have you ever noticed
that if one animal jumps at a certain place, all the following sheep
jump at the same place? Have you ever seen sheep fighting? Were the
combatants rams or ewes? How did they fight?</p>

<p>What is the voice of a sheep like?</p>

<p>3. <b>Lambs.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Appearance.</i>—At what time of the year
are lambs born? Are they helpless or active? Have they long legs? What
advantage to the lamb is length of limb?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Play.</i>—Watch lambs playing. Do they show a preference for any
eminence, <i>e.g.</i> a rock, in the neighbourhood? What is the meaning of
this preference? How do lambs fight? Have you ever seen a ewe stamp
with her fore-feet when anyone approached her lamb? At what age is a
sheep full grown?</p>

<p><b>The sheep.</b>—The sheep (<a href="#FIG_173">Fig. 173</a>) differs in several
important respects from any of the animals previously mentioned. It is of course
a mammal, for it suckles its young, and its body is covered by hair;
but the hair is of that warm fleecy kind which is called <b>wool</b>.
The fibres of wool are seen under the microscope to be rough and scaly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
For this reason they can be spun into loosely-textured threads which
entangle a great deal of air; woollen garments are thus very bad
conductors of heat. The wool upon the sheep’s body is slightly greasy,
from a substance which is given off by the skin and protects the animal
from rain. The toes of the sheep are not armed with ordinary nails or
claws, but claws are represented by horny masses called <b>hoofs</b>,
which encase the ends of the toes, and upon which the whole weight of
the body is thrown. The sheep, especially the male (ram), is often
provided with weapons in the form of hollow <b>horns</b>, which grow
upon its forehead.</p>

            to show the internal structure.<br /> For description, see text.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Method of feeding.</b>—The sheep is a strict vegetarian, living
largely upon grass. It grips the grass between its lower incisor teeth
and a hard pad on the upper jaw; there are no incisor teeth in the
upper jaw. Neither upper nor lower jaw bears canine teeth; and the
cheek teeth, which are used for chewing the food, have their crowns
ridged lengthwise. The arrangement of the teeth of the sheep is shown
in <a href="#FIG_174">Fig. 174</a>. During grazing, however, the food is not at
once chewed, but is simply mixed with a large quantity of saliva and swallowed,
the chewing-process being performed at a later period. It is obviously a
great advantage to an animal, which in the wild state is liable at any
moment to be attacked by enemies, to be able to stow away its food
quickly, and afterwards masticate it at leisure. This is rendered
possible, in oxen, sheep, goats, deer, and the few other animals which
chew the cud, by the peculiar form of stomach shown in <a href="#FIG_175">Fig. 175</a>.
The hastily swallowed food is passed into the large paunch <i>b</i> and into the
compartment <i>c</i>. When the animal finds an opportunity of “ruminating”
or chewing the cud, the food is returned to the mouth in small
quantities at a time, and is there finely divided by the cheek teeth.
In this condition it is again swallowed, and makes its way at once into
the compartment <i>d</i>, where it is strained between leaf-like folds and
then passed into the last chamber <i>e</i>, and thence to the intestines, to
undergo the final processes of digestion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Ruminants.</b>—Animals which, like the sheep, oxen, goats,
deer, etc., ruminate or chew the cud in this manner, are called
<b>ruminants</b>. In all ruminants the weight of the body is supported
by the tips of the third and fourth toes of the feet, the remaining
toes either having completely disappeared or remaining very small (<a href="#FIG_176-177">Fig. 176</a>).
The tips of the toes are encased in horny hoofs, which represent
greatly enlarged claws or nails. The ruminants therefore belong to
what may be called the <b>even-toed hoofed mammals</b>. Pigs are also
even-toed hoofed mammals, but they are not ruminants, because, having
simple stomachs, they do not chew the cud.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_176-177" id="FIG_176-177"></a>
    <img src="images/i_261.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="327" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 176.</span>—Bones of fore-foot of Red Deer.
      <span class="ws3">&nbsp;</span><span class="smcap">Fig. 177.</span>—Bones of fore-foot of Horse.<br />
       (After Flower.)<span class="ws14">&nbsp;</span>(After Flower.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Other hoofed mammals.</b>—In the horse and donkey the reduction of
the number of toes has gone still further; for these animals have now
only the third or middle toe of each foot left (<a href="#FIG_176-177">Fig. 177</a>);
and because it has to carry the whole weight of the body, it has become very large
and stout; its tip is encased in a hoof.</p>

<p>The <b>hoofed mammals</b> are therefore divided into two groups:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(1) the <i>odd-toed</i>, including the horse and ass (they have simple
stomachs, and therefore do not chew the cud); and</p>

<p>(2) the <i>even-toed</i>, including (<i>a</i>) ruminants like the sheep, etc.,
and (<i>b</i>) such non-ruminants as the pigs and their relatives.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p><b>The inherited habits of the sheep.</b>—As in the cases of the dog
and cat, so in the sheep, the true explanation of several curious
habits is to be found in the manner of life of the wild ancestors;
for it must be remembered that domestication, however kindly an
animal may take to it, is an artificial condition of life. Wild sheep
live in flocks, as a rule in cold and mountainous districts; and
some organisation is necessary if they are not to be at the mercy
of savage carnivores. An old and experienced ram is generally in
charge of the flock, and in case of alarm he leads the way to a more
inaccessible position. The rest of the flock follow in single file,
closely imitating his every movement, leaping without hesitation—and
therefore saving valuable time—wherever he has leapt. The survival of
this instinct in domestic sheep may be observed whenever a flock is
travelling along the road. Even young lambs still display a decided
preference for rocks, hillocks, and other elevated positions. Wild
sheep, being so liable to sudden interruption when grazing, are enabled
by their compound stomachs to swallow food quickly and postpone the
chewing process to a more favourable opportunity. Sentinels usually
keep watch, and warn the flock of approaching enemies by stamping their
hoofs on the ground, an action which may still be seen whenever a ewe
fears danger to her lambs.</p>

<p><b>The play and education of the young.</b>—The young of mammals are
usually under the care of the mother for education and protection until
they are nearly adult; and it is generally found that the longest
infancy (in proportion to the natural life of the animal) occurs in the
most intelligent races. The importance of the play and education period
is very great, for it not only gives the young animal an opportunity of
training its natural faculties in comparative safety, by exercise of
various kinds and by games with companions of its own age and strength;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
but it allows the mother to impart, by direct instruction, some of the
experience which she has personally gained during her life. The extent
of this maternal education is greater than has been generally supposed;
and every opportunity should be taken of observing and recording cases
of it.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The play of young animals also in many cases gives important clues to
lost ancestral habits, which are not now to be seen in adult life. The
inherited tendency of animals to repeat, during their own development,
the history of their race is very great; some striking cases of this
will be considered in later chapters.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"> THE PIGEON: A TYPICAL BIRD.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>51. HABITS AND STRUCTURE OF THE PIGEON.</h4>

<p>1. <b>General observations upon the dovecote pigeon.</b>—Watch a
group of pigeons. What is the shape of the body? With
what is the body covered? What is the colour of the feathers?
Does the bird walk or hop? How many walking limbs has it?
Has it any other means of moving from place to place, in
addition to walking? How many wings has it? Are the wings
anterior or posterior (<a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a>) to the legs? Watch
a pigeon preening its feathers; why does it apply its bill so frequently to
its tail? Can the bird bend its neck easily in all directions? On
what do pigeons feed? How do they pick up their food? Do
they chew the food? What is the voice of the pigeon like? At
what time of the year do pigeons moult? How many eggs does
the hen-pigeon lay? What is the colour of the eggs? What
are newly-hatched pigeons like? How do the parent birds
feed them?</p>

<p>Try to find a wood-pigeon’s nest. What is its shape? What
is it made of? Is the top open or closed-in?</p>

<p>2. <b>The external characters.</b>—Closely examine a dead pigeon in
respect of the following features:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Feathers.</i>—In what direction do the free ends of the
feathers point? Where are the longest feathers?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The head.</i>—What is the general shape of the head?
Notice the horny <i>bill</i>; is it blunt, pointed, or hooked? Does it
bear teeth? Observe the <i>cere</i>, a whitish patch of swollen skin at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
each side of the base of the upper beak, and surrounding the <i>nostril</i>.
Examine the large <i>eyes</i>, and notice the upper and lower eyelids and
the transparent third eyelid. Find the <i>ear-opening</i>, a little below
and behind the level of the eye, and hidden by the small feathers of
the neck. Open the mouth and see the pointed <i>tongue</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The neck.</i>—In the feathered bird this appears short; it will be
better seen after the removal of the feathers (contour feathers) which
cover it.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The trunk.</i>—What is the apparent shape of the trunk? Where is
its heaviest part?</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The wings.</i>—Open out the wings fully and measure the distance
from tip to tip; compare it with the length of the trunk. Which
surface, upper or lower, of the expanded wing is rounded (convex)
and which is hollowed (concave)? Put up an umbrella and, holding it
by the handle, move it quickly (i) away from you, (ii) towards you.
In which direction of motion does the air offer more resistance? Is
it an advantage for the expanded wing to be convex above and concave
below? Why? Feel the wing-bones through the skin, and notice that the
wing-skeleton consists of three parts corresponding to the bones of
your upper-arm, fore-arm, and hand (with the wrist) respectively; and
that they are bent on each other in the form of a Z when the wings
are folded. The large <i>quill-feathers</i> attached to the segment which
corresponds to the hand and wrist are called <i>primaries</i>; count them.
Those attached to the fore-arm are called <i>secondaries</i>; count them.
Find the tuft of smaller feathers which spring, at the front edge
of the wing, from the thumb; this tuft is called the <i>thumb-wing</i>.
The primaries and secondaries collectively may be called the rowing
feathers. Notice the smaller feathers which, on both the upper and
lower surface of the wing, cover the quills of the primaries and
secondaries; these smaller feathers are called the <i>wing-coverts</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>The legs.</i>—Feel the leg-bones through the skin, and make out
the various segments. Is the whole of the hind-limb feathered? Which
part is devoid of feathers? With what is this part covered? How many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
toes are there? Do any point backwards? Stretch out the legs and notice
that the toes open. Bend the ankle-joint and notice that the toes close
automatically. Of what use is this in perching?</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) <i>The tail.</i>—Examine the tail and notice the large quill-feathers
attached to it; count them. As they are largely used for steering
during flight they are sometimes called the steering feathers.</p>
</div>

<p>3. <b>The feathers.</b>—Examine the arrangement of the feathers. The
short feathers which clothe the body generally are called <i>contour
feathers</i> because they determine the contour of the unplucked bird;
remove one or two and place them aside. The feathers which cover
the bases of the large quills are called <i>coverts</i>—wing-coverts or
tail-coverts according to their position. Remove one or two for future
examination. Examine the arrangement of the <i>quill-feathers</i> of the
wings, and notice how the vane or web of one partially overlaps the
next. The vane is supported by a shaft. Are the two sides of the vane
of equal width? Is the narrower side directed forwards or backwards?
Pull out a quill-feather from each wing and compare them. How could you
recognise, if you did not know, whether any particular feather had come
from the right or from the left wing? Pull out a quill-feather from the
tail; are the sides of the vane of equal width?</p>

<p>4. <b>Examination of various feathers.</b>—Examine in detail a
<i>quill-feather</i> from the wing. Make out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>The quill.</i>—Is it hollow or solid? Try to bend it and notice
its great strength. Observe the small hole at its base.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The shaft.</i>—This is the prolongation of the quill, and carries
the web or vane. Is the shaft hollow or solid? Notice the small tuft of
down on the inner face of the feather, at the junction of the quill and
shaft.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The vane.</i>—Hold up the feather to the light and examine the
vane with a lens. Notice that the vane consists of a number of laths
which spring from the shaft; these are called <i>barbs</i>. Try to separate
the barbs, and observe that they offer considerable resistance to the
pull, as if they were somehow fastened together. Examine a barb with a
strong lens and observe the finer branches, called <i>barbules</i>, which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
bears. The barbules on one side of the barb carry little hooks, while
those of the other side bear flanges, on which fit the hooks of
barbules carried by the next barb below. The hooks and flanges cannot
be seen without a microscope.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Other feathers.</i>—Compare the <i>covert</i> and <i>contour feathers</i>
with the quill feathers. Observe, in the contour feathers, the less
perfect interlocking of the barbs of those parts which are covered by
other feathers.</p>
</div>

<p>Pluck the pigeon, and notice the hair-like structures left in the skin.
They are called <i>filoplumes</i>. Pull one out and examine it with a lens;
it bears a few barbs at its upper end, but these do not interlock.</p>

<p>Examine a nestling-pigeon, and notice the <i>down-feathers</i> which clothe
it temporarily. Each is at first covered at the base with a horny
sheath. The barbs do not interlock. The down-feathers are pushed off by
the growth of the permanent feathers.</p>

<p>5. <b>The plucked pigeon.</b>—Observe that feathers do not grow on
all parts of the body, but are confined to definite <i>feather-tracts</i>,
which can be recognised by the scars left by the quills. Notice
especially the sockets of the large wing-and tail-quills. Make out
the <i>oil-gland</i>, a small knob just above the tip of the true tail. It
furnishes a lubricating fluid used in preening the feathers. Examine
more closely the different regions of the body—the neck, the joints of
the limbs, etc., which were disguised by the feathers. The filoplumes
have already been seen. Feel the great <i>muscles of the breast</i>, and the
edge of the <i>sternum</i> or breast-bone in the middle line. Just in front
of this feel the soft crop, with the grain which is probably present in
it.</p>

<p>Before boiling the bird in order to separate and examine the bones,
open the <i>crop</i> and inspect its contents. Cut away the enormous muscles
of the breast (why are they so large?) and open the body-cavity behind
and remove the internal organs, being careful not to break any bones.</p>

<p>6. <b>The skeleton.</b>—Boil the bird until the flesh can be easily
removed. A small nail-brush will be found useful in cleaning the bones.
Keep as many of these in contact as possible, and make out and examine
the following parts:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>The skull</i>, with the rounded brain-case, horny beak, and large
eye-sockets. Notice, at the back of the skull, the <i>single</i> knob, which
fits into a hollow on the first vertebra.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The backbone.</i>—Notice the long neck, the fusion of many of
the vertebrae in the trunk-region, and, at the end of the tail, the
“ploughshare bone.” This last supports the tail-quills.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The breast-bone</i>, or sternum, produced ventrally into a thin
plate called the <i>keel</i> (to which were attached the great muscles of
the breast), and connected by ribs to the backbone.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The position of the <i>shoulder joint</i>, and the socket for the bone
of the upper-arm. Notice the <b>V</b>-shaped “merrythought.”</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The bones of the fore-limb</i> (wing).—Make out the parts
belonging to the upper-arm, fore-arm, and wrist and hand, and notice
that the bones of the wrist and hand are firmly fused together to give
increased strength.</p>

<p>(f) <i>The large hip-bones.</i>—Notice their forward extension and fusion
with the joined vertebrae of this region, and the resulting increased
firmness of this part.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) The bones of the <i>hind-limbs</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>7. <b>Pneumatic bones.</b>—Examine the bone of the upper-arm of the
pigeon and notice, just below the head of the bone, a small hole
which leads into the interior. Break the bone across; is it hollow or
solid? Does the inside contain marrow? How does it differ from the
corresponding bone of a rabbit?</p>

<p>8. <b>Different breeds.</b>—Examine various breeds of domestic
pigeons, and compare them with the common variety, as regards colour,
shape, method of flight, extent of feathering of the hind-limbs, etc.</p>

<p><b>Birds.</b>—It is probable that no class of animals has been more
studied than that of the birds; and the reasons for this are not
difficult to find. The wonderful power of flight—rivalled only by
the insects—and the perfect adaptation of structure to this power;
the habits, always interesting and in many cases showing a curious
parallelism to human institutions; the beautiful voices of song birds;
the grace of movement; the mysteries of migration; and, it may be
added, the remarkable story of the origin of birds which has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
revealed by modern zoology,—form a combination of characters, at once
familiar and elusive, which has greatly stimulated human sympathy and
imagination. It is well to begin the study of birds by first taking
one familiar species and examining it somewhat closely, and afterwards
comparing and contrasting other members of the class. Such a convenient
type for study is found in the dovecote pigeon.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><b>The pigeon.</b>—The body of the common dovecote pigeon (<a href="#FIG_178">Fig. 178</a>)
is ovoid in shape, tapering gently at the neck and appearing, in the
living animal, to pass insensibly into the head. The fore-limbs are
modified to form a pair of <b>wings</b>, which are set on a little
above and in front of the centre of gravity of the body. Except during
flight the weight of the body is entirely supported by the hind-limbs
or <b>legs</b>, which are fixed almost exactly below the centre of
gravity of the body, <i>i.e.</i> in the best imaginable position. Each foot
bears four toes, the first of which is directed backwards. Each toe is
armed with a claw.</p>

<p>The body generally is clothed with <b>feathers</b>, remarkable
structures which are as characteristic of birds as hairs are (<a href="#Page_220">p. 220</a>)
of mammals. The great majority of the feathers are small, overlapping
and plate-like, with their free ends pointing backwards; and they form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
a light, warm, and smooth covering which is admirably adapted to the
animal’s needs. Certain large feathers, carried by the wings and tail,
are used in flight. The legs are feathered to the ankle-joint, but the
feet are covered only with scales. The general colour of the dovecote
pigeon is a slaty blue.</p>

<p>The head is rounded, and terminates in front in a horny <b>bill</b>,
which does not bear teeth. At the base of the upper beak there is, on
each side, a whitish patch of swollen skin called the <b>cere</b>,
which surrounds the opening of the <b>nostril</b>. The <b>eyes</b>
are large and round; in addition to upper and lower eyelids, each is
provided with a transparent <b>third eyelid</b>, which can be flicked
rapidly across the eyeball. Birds generally have very powerful sight
and depend more upon this sense than upon any other. There are no
external ears, but when the feathers are separated, a little below
and behind the eyes, a pair of apertures leading to the internal
<b>ears</b> may be seen.</p>

<p><b>Habits.</b>—The pigeon lives upon grain, which it picks up by means
of its horny bill. The length and flexibility of the neck are a great
help in feeding. The food is swallowed immediately and passed into a
large bag called the <b>crop</b>, which is really a dilatation of the
lower part of the gullet. Here it is macerated for some time before it
passes onward to the true stomach. The hinder part of the stomach is
called the <b>gizzard</b>; it has very thick walls and a hard horny
lining. In the gizzard the food is ground up by the aid of small stones
which the pigeon swallows for the purpose. The stomach is followed by a
much-coiled intestine, in which the process of digestion is completed.</p>

<p>The pigeon differs from many birds in walking instead of hopping.
When perching, it bends its legs at the ankles, an action which
automatically closes the toes in such a manner that the perch is
grasped behind by the first toe and in front by the second, third, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
fourth. The weight of the body is sufficient to maintain a tight clasp
upon the perch, so that the bird is able to sleep comfortably in this
position.</p>

<p>The hen-pigeon lays two white <b>eggs</b>, which are sat upon by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
parents for fourteen days and thereby kept at a temperature of about 40
degrees Centigrade. The young birds then break through the shell and
are hatched. As the chicks are at first quite helpless and unable to
feed themselves, the parents supply them with a milky fluid secreted by
their crops. This is sometimes called “pigeon’s milk.” Newly hatched
pigeons are covered with fine feathers called <b>down</b>, which are
pushed off by the development of the permanent feathers beneath them.
The nests of wood-pigeons (<a href="#FIG_180">Fig. 180</a>) are usually
built in trees; they are somewhat rough structures, composed of twigs,
and open at the top.</p>

<p><b>The wings.</b>—A bird’s wings are full of interest, from whatever
point of view they are considered. Even now, the exact manner in which
they and the tail are used to bring about the many different movements
of flight is not fully understood; but a general idea may be obtained
by an examination of the bones and feathers and the careful observation
of flying birds.

</div>

<p>The <b>bones</b> of the fore-limb and the neighbouring regions show a
remarkable modification of the primitive plan. The bones of the upper
arm <i>OA</i>, (<a href="#FIG_181">Fig. 181</a>) and fore-arm (<i>Rd.</i>, <i>Ul.</i>,)
are arranged much like the corresponding bones of the rabbit; but those of the wrist and
hand are unlike anything we have yet examined. The fourth and fifth
fingers have entirely disappeared; and the first (thumb), second, and
third, though they can be still recognised (Figs. <a href="#FIG_181">181</a>, <i>F</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>F</i>
and <a href="#FIG_184A"> 184<i>a</i></a>), have become consolidated with what remains of the wrist
(<i>HW</i>, <i>MH</i>) to form a firm mass which is in no danger of “giving”
during the powerful down-stroke of the wing. The head of the bone of
the upper arm fits into a socket (<i>gl.cv.</i>, <a href="#FIG_182">Fig. 182</a>) at
the junction of the shoulder-blade (<i>scp.</i>) and another and stouter bone (<i>cor.</i>)
which runs back and is attached to the breast-bone or sternum (<i>st.</i>).
The sternum in its turn is connected by means of ribs with the spinal
column, which is strengthened here by the fusion of some of its bones.
The ventral part of the sternum is produced into a large plate called
the <i>keel</i> (<i>car.</i>, <a href="#FIG_182">Fig. 182</a>), which gives attachment
to the great muscles of the breast, used in the movements of the wings. So great is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the development of these muscles in flying birds that in the pigeon
they have a weight equal to one-fifth the total weight of the body. The
three segments of the wing, corresponding to the upper-arm, fore-arm,
and wrist and hand respectively are, in the position of rest, bent upon
each other like the letter <b>Z</b>. The large quill <b>feathers</b> of
the wing, fixed along the hinder border of the limb, are in two series
(<a href="#FIG_179">Fig. 179</a>). Those attached to the fore-arm are called <i>secondaries</i>;
while those attached to the wrist and hand are known as <i>primaries</i>. A
smaller tuft of feathers borne by the thumb is called the bastard-wing
or <i>thumb-wing</i>. The smaller feathers covering the bases of the
wing-quills are called <i>wing-coverts</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The hind-limbs and tail.</b>—The hind-limbs, or legs, of birds are
the sole support of the body except during flight, and a relatively
great weight is thus thrown upon them. To provide for this, the
skeleton of the hip region is exceptionally strong. Not only are the
bones of the spine here welded together into one solid mass, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
hip-bones extend forward much further than is the case in quadrupeds,
and are firmly attached to the fused vertebrae. Each hip-bone possesses
a socket (<i>actb</i>., <a href="#FIG_182">Fig. 182</a>) into which fits the head
of the bone of the upper leg. Another fusion of bones is to be noticed at the end
of the tail, resulting in the <i>ploughshare-bone</i> (<a href="#FIG_182">Fig. 182</a>, <i>pyg. st.</i>)
which supports the large <i>steering feathers</i> of the tail. The quills of
these feathers are covered at their bases by the <i>tail-coverts</i>.</p>

<p>Just above the end of the tail of a plucked pigeon is to be seen a
small conical body, the <i>oil-gland</i>, from which the bird obtains a
fluid which it applies to the feathers during the preening process.</p>

<p><b>The feathers.</b>—Feathers do not grow upon all parts of a bird’s
body, but are restricted to certain definite areas or “<i>feather
tracts</i>” which, however, differ in arrangement in different species.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the large feathers of the wing of the pigeon is illustrated in
<a href="#FIG_183">Fig. 183</a>, <i>A</i>. It consists of a hollow, horny <b>quill</b>
(<i>cal.</i>), prolonged into a solid <b>shaft</b> (<i>rch.</i>) which supports the web
or <b>vane</b>. The outer face of the feather is slightly convex and
smooth; while the inner surface is somewhat concave and rough, and
carries a little tuft of down at the junction of quill and shaft. The
growing feather is nourished by a conical projection of the deeper part
of the skin, which fits into a small hole (<i>inf. umb.</i>) at the base of
the quill. It is easily shown that the vane of the feather is composed,
on each side, of a large number of parallel laths which spring from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
shaft. These laths are called <b>barbs</b>. Considerable resistance is
felt when an attempt is made to pull the barbs apart, but the manner
of their connection cannot be clearly seen without the aid of the
microscope. A fairly low magnifying power, however, shows (<a href="#FIG_184">Fig. 184</a>)
that each barb bears extremely delicate threads—<b>barbules</b>—on
each side, arranged on the barb much as the barbs are arranged on
the shaft. The barbules on one side of each barb (the side furthest
from the quill) are seen to carry tiny <i>hooks</i>; while the barbules
of the other side of the barb are furnished with <i>flanges</i>. The
hooked barbules of one barb cross the flanged barbules of the next
and interlock with them; so that relatively great force is required
to pull the barbs apart and destroy the continuity of the web. The
quill-feathers of the tail, and the coverts, have webs of similar
structure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

      barbule; <i>C</i>, two adjacent flanged barbules; <i>D</i>, a hooked barbule.
      (After Pycraft.)</p>
</div>

<p>The <b>contour-feathers</b> are used for protection and warmth rather
than for flight, and hence have less-perfectly interlocking barbs. The
hair-like structures seen on the skin of the plucked bird are extremely
simple feathers called <b>filoplumes</b> (<a href="#FIG_183">Fig. 183</a>, <i>B</i>).
Each consists of a long, slender axis, bearing at the end a few barbs which
do not interlock.</p>

<p>The <b>down-feathers</b> (<a href="#FIG_183">Fig. 183</a>, <i>C</i>), which form
the temporary covering of nestling pigeons, also bear barbs which do not interlock.</p>

<p>At regular intervals, either once or twice a year, birds <b>moult</b>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
that is, shed most or all of their feathers and grow new ones. The
moulting usually takes place gradually and symmetrically: a flight
feather from each wing, for example, being dropped at the same time.</p>

<p><b>Flight.</b>—The outstretched wing of a pigeon has a relatively
great area; and is markedly convex on the upper surface and concave
on the lower, resembling in this respect an open umbrella. The great
difference in the resistance which the inside and outside of an open
umbrella respectively oppose to the wind is familiar to everyone, and
illustrates the advantage of the dome-shape of the outstretched wing.
The force which the great breast-muscles put into the down-stroke of
the wing is enormous in comparison with the weight of the body, and
is sufficient to push the bird upwards and forwards in the air. The
gently tapering shape and smooth surface of the feathered bird diminish
the resistance of the air. When the wing is raised again for the next
stroke, the quill-feathers are turned a little edgewise, so that the
air slips between them; just as an oarsman “feathers” his oar to lessen
the resistance to the blade in the return-stroke. The direction of the
wing-stroke can be altered in accordance with the direction of air
currents, and the fan of tail-feathers is capable of being opened or
closed, raised or lowered, and turned at various angles to act as a
rudder.</p>

<p>But the method of flight which perhaps most of all excites the
observer’s admiration is <b>soaring</b>, in which the bird seems to
remain almost passive, with outstretched wings and spread tail, and
mounts automatically in a spiral course. Exactly how the soaring is
performed, only the birds themselves know; but it must be similar in
essence to the arrangement of the sails of a yacht so as to select that
component of the force of the breeze which will drive the boat in the
required direction, even though this be almost “in the teeth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
wind.” Such spiral soaring may be seen to perfection, among common
British birds, in the skylark (<a href="#Page_316">p. 316</a>).
A breeze is necessary for soaring.</p>

<p>In <b>hovering</b>, the motion of the wings is extremely rapid, and
the bird remains poised in one place. The kestrel (<a href="#Page_330">p. 330</a>)
derives its common name of “windhover” from its habit of using this method of
flight when looking for food.</p>

<p><b>The pigeon’s air supply.</b>—We know that a man breathes more
quickly when he is taking active exercise than at ordinary times; and
we might, from this and similar observations, expect to find the most
perfect breathing organs in animals which lead the most active lives.
Of all vertebrate animals, birds probably perform the most work in
proportion to their size; and it is not surprising, therefore, to learn
that they have special facilities for quickly replacing fouled air by fresh.</p>

<p>The <b>lungs</b> are comparatively small, but they are not the only
organs of respiration (<a href="#Page_242">p. 242</a>); for the windpipe opens
also into several <b>air-sacs</b>, which supply nearly all parts of the body with
air, and even communicate with the interior of certain bones. The bone
of the pigeon’s upper-arm, for example, is hollow and contains air. By
means of the system of air-sacs, the air in the lungs is <i>completely</i>
renewed at each respiratory act, and thus the waste carbon-dioxide in
the blood can be exchanged for fresh oxygen much more completely than
it is in mammals. One result of this is that the blood of birds is much
warmer than that of mammals. The air-sacs are also an assistance to
flight by rendering the body more buoyant.</p>

<p><b>Different breeds of pigeons.</b>—The various breeds of domestic
pigeons furnish one of the best examples of the changes in structure
which breeders can bring about, after several generations, by careful
crossing. In spite of the great differences between, say, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
<b>tumbler</b>, with its habit of turning head-over-heels in the air;
the <b>pouter</b>, with its exaggerated crop; the <b>Jacobin</b>,
with its neck-feathers reversed; the <b>fantail</b>, with its large
number of erect tail-feathers; and others,—there can be no doubt
that all these varieties have been artificially produced from the
<b>rock-pigeon</b>; and it is curious to observe occasional reversions
to the characters of the ancestral stock. “The rock-pigeon is of a
slaty blue, with white loins.... The tail has a terminal dark bar,
with the outer feathers externally edged at the base with white. The
wings have two black bars. Some semi-domestic breeds, and some truly
wild breeds, have, besides the two black bars, the wings chequered
with black. These several marks do not occur together in any other
species of the whole family. Now, in every one of the domestic breeds,
taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all the above marks, even to the
white edging of the outer tail-feathers, sometimes concur perfectly
developed. Moreover, when two birds belonging to two or more distinct
breeds are crossed, none of which are blue or have any of the
above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly
to acquire these characters.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
This is a striking instance of the tendency exhibited by living things
to revert to ancestral characters, even though these latter may have
lain dormant for hundreds of generations.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION OF THE CHICK.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>52. A HEN’S EGG.</h4>

<p>Obtain three or four hen’s-eggs, and make the following observations
upon them:</p>

<p>1. <b>External appearance.</b>—What is the <i>colour</i> of the egg? What
is its <i>shape</i>? How does the shape differ from that of a cricket ball
or other sphere? The shape of an egg is said to be ovoid. [What is the
difference between an ovoid and an oval?] Measure, with a tape, the
length and breadth of the egg, and also its distance round, (i) in the
direction of its greatest length, (ii) in the direction of its greatest
width. What advantages has this shape? Could a hen sit so comfortably
upon her eggs if they had sharp corners? Put an egg upon the table
and roll it gently. Does it roll in a straight line? Does it roll far
before coming to rest? Compare the rolling of a cricket ball or other
sphere. Is it an advantage that an egg is not likely to roll far, or in
a straight line? Why?</p>

<p>2. <b>The strength of the shell.</b>—Hold an egg with your thumb at
one end and your first or second finger at the other, and press exactly
in the line of the length of the egg. You cannot break the shell.</p>

<p>3. <b>Structure.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>The shell.</i>—Tap the egg gently at the
middle of its broad end until the shell cracks. Then carefully remove
small pieces of the shell and notice the <i>shell-membrane</i>, a tough skin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
which is closely applied to the inside of the shell. Snip through the
membrane in the middle of the broad end; notice the <i>air-chamber</i>
which lies beneath it. Observe the inner membrane which separates the
air-chamber from the inside of the egg. Hold a piece of shell up to
the light, and notice the small, almost transparent dots. The shell is
perforated by very small pores, through which the air can pass.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The white of the egg.</i>—Tap the shell so as to crack it all
round at its widest part; raise bits of shell carefully and see the
membrane here. Tear through the membrane and notice that in this
region there is no air-space, but the white lies just beneath the
shell-membrane. Separate the halves of the shell, notice the position
and shape of the yolk, and then let the contents of the egg fall gently
into a basin. Observe the appearance, colour, and transparency of the
white, and try to distinguish two tangled cords of firmer white—the
<i>balancers</i> (<a href="#FIG_185">Fig. 185</a>)—arising close to the yellow yolk.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The yolk.</i>—What is the shape of the yolk as it lies in the
basin? How does it differ from the shape of a yolk suspended naturally
in the white? What is the cause of the change of shape? Notice
carefully a small paler patch in the middle of the upper surface. This
is the lightest part of the yolk, so that the yolk always settles with
this part uppermost after any turning of the egg, and therefore the
pale patch is always more directly exposed to the heat of the hen’s
body (during incubation) than is any other part of the yolk. Prick the
yolk and notice that the yellow, fluid contents flow out. You have
evidently pierced the thin bag which formerly preserved the shape.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>A hard-boiled egg.</i>—Boil an egg in water for five minutes,
and then chip round the shell in the direction of the length and,
with a sharp knife, cut the whole egg into halves along this plane.
Make a drawing of the section, indicating the shell, shell-membrane,
air-chamber, white, and yolk in position. Observe that the white is no
longer transparent and fluid, but an opaque, white, and elastic solid.
Try to peel off the white in layers. They will probably break off
short, but you may be able to see that the white is deposited in spiral
sheets around the yolk.

<p><b>The hen’s egg.</b>—A hen’s egg bears a somewhat similar relation to
the adult bird that the maize or bean seed (<a href="#Page_1">Chapter I.</a>)
bears to the adult plant; for the egg contains</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(1) a speck of living matter which little by little grows and becomes
marked off, by orderly arrangement, to form the various regions and
organs of the adult animal; and</p>

<p>(2) a store of food, which enables the young chick to develop in
security, without being hampered, whilst still weak and helpless, by
the necessity of earning its own living. The changes by which the speck
of living matter becomes the perfect chick will be considered in the
next section. We must now examine the structure of the egg itself, and
see what provision it contains for the nourishment and safety of the
developing bird.</p>
</div>

<p>The egg is ovoid in <b>shape</b>, one end being distinctly broader than
the other. This shape has the advantage of preventing the egg from
rolling very far when placed upon a slightly inclined surface, and it
is worthy of notice that the eggs of birds which lay on cliffs and
other exposed situations are usually more elongated and pointed than
others, so that when stirred they do not roll away, but simply describe
a small circle and come to rest again. In the case of eggs which are
laid in cup-shaped nests (<a href="#FIG_197">Fig. 197</a>) the pear-shape lends
itself to close packing, and thus allows the eggs to be more easily kept warm
by the parent bird.</p>

<p>The <b>shell</b> (<i>sh.</i>, <a href="#FIG_185">Fig. 185</a>) is composed of
a chalky material, and is perforated by small pores, through which the developing
chick obtains fresh oxygen from the air, and gives off its surplus carbon
dioxide (<a href="#Page_242">p. 242</a>). A small piece of shell easily snaps,
but the shape of the complete shell so distributes an outside pressure, especially
one in the direction of the long axis, that relatively great force is
required to break it. The shell is lined by a thin, parchment-like
<b>membrane</b> (<i>sh. m.</i>). At the broad end of the egg this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
membrane is double, and the two layers enclose an <b>air-chamber</b>
(<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>Inside the shell-membrane are the white or albumin, and the yolk. The
<b>white</b> (<i>alb´.</i>) is a viscous, transparent fluid. Its innermost
part (<i>alb.</i>), which immediately surrounds the yolk, is of thicker
consistency than the rest, and is prolonged into two twisted cords
called the <b>balancers</b> (<i>ch.</i>), which suspend the yolk in position.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The <b>yolk</b> is a golden-yellow fluid enclosed in a thin, elastic
membrane and hence preserving a spherical shape. On its upper surface
(but under the membrane) is a small circular patch (<i>bl.</i>) of paler
colour. This patch, called the <b>germinal disc</b>, is about ⅛” in
diameter; it contains the living matter from which the chick will be
formed; the rest of the yolk, and the white, are simply a store of
inert food which is used up by the growing chick.</p>

<p><b>The work of the balancers.</b>—In order that the small living patch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
of pale yolk, the germinal disc, may grow and develop into the chick
it must be kept warm. When eggs are hatched in the natural manner, the
heat is supplied by the body of the sitting hen, and the upper part of
the egg is consequently kept warmer than the rest. It is important that
the living part of the egg shall always lie nearest the hen’s body and
thus be kept warm, and this is secured by an arrangement as effective
as it is simple. The yolk is lightest in the neighbourhood of the
germinal disc, and therefore always lies with this part uppermost. If
the egg is slowly turned over, the yolk remains “right side up.” If it
is turned over quickly, the yolk soon swings round into its original
position. The twisted cords of white, the balancers, not only sling
up the yolk and guard it from being thrown to one side by a sudden
movement, but they also prevent it from rotating too quickly—and so
possibly injuring the delicate body of the young chick—when it rights
itself after the egg has been turned over.</p>

<p>The balancers are rendered necessary by the hen’s habit of turning her
eggs two or three times a day. It is often supposed that the eggs are
turned in order to keep them equally warm on all sides, but this is
unnecessary. Most probably the egg is turned in order to alter slightly
the young chick’s position from time to time, and allow its parts to
grow naturally, unimpeded by the other contents of the egg.</p>

<h4>53. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHICK.</h4>

<p>1. <b>A simple incubator.</b>—Eggs are best incubated in the natural
manner, that is, by the warmth of the hen’s body; but if a sitting
hen cannot be obtained, an ordinary water-oven, such as is used in
chemical laboratories, may be made to answer. It should be heated by a
self-regulating burner, and kept at a temperature of about 40° C. The
eggs should be turned two or three times a day, and the air of the oven
should be kept moist by sprinkling water upon pieces of cloth, blotting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
paper, or hay, kept with the eggs. Spring is the most favourable time
of the year for making the observations, as eggs laid at other seasons
are not always in a condition to produce chicks.</p>

<p>2. <b>How to mark the eggs.</b>—The most instructive changes take
place during the first five days of incubation. If all the stages of
the first five days are to form the subject of one lesson, an egg
should be marked “5” with pencil, and then put into the incubator or
under the hen five days before the lesson; a day later, an egg numbered
“4” should be put in, and so on. The numbers will then indicate the
length of incubation at the time of the lesson, and the eggs should be
examined in order, from 1 to 5. If one egg is to be examined each day,
five should be put in the incubator at the same time; no numbering will
then be required.</p>

<p>3. <b>How to examine the eggs.</b>—Have ready a basin of water,
heated slightly above the temperature of the hand (<i>i.e.</i> to about
40° C.), and dissolve table-salt in it in the proportion of a level
teaspoonful of salt to a pint of water. The young chicks will keep
alive longer in this solution than in ordinary water. Tap the shell
in the middle of its broad end, and open the air-chamber (<i>a</i>, <a href="#FIG_185">Fig. 185</a> )
completely. Then crack the shell in the middle of the length and,
keeping the length of the egg horizontal, cut transversely round
the middle of the shell with scissors in a vertical plane, until the
halves are on the point of coming apart. Then lower the egg into the
warm saline solution, pull the halves of the shell apart, and float
out the contents. Examine the embryo carefully, making out as much as
possible, and then snip round it with a pair of fine scissors to remove
it from the yolk; float it into a watch-glass and cover it with weak
alcohol (equal parts of water and spirits of wine). Examine it with a
lens. After it has remained for a day in weak alcohol, put the embryo
into strong alcohol in a small bottle (writing the age on a label), and
preserve it.</p>

<p>Notice the gradual absorption of the white of the egg as development
proceeds.</p>

<p>4. <b>Chick after one day’s incubation.</b>—Notice that the embryo is
now to be distinguished as a streak crossing the germinal disc in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
direction at right angles to the long axis of the egg. Notice a rounded
swelling at one end of the embryo; this is the <i>head</i>. Place the egg
before you with the broad end to your left, and observe that the head
of the embryo points away from you.</p>

<p>5. <b>Chick after two days’ incubation.</b>—Observe the increase in
size of the embryo; make a note of its length. The head and neck of
the embryo are now almost covered by a very thin transparent bag which
has grown over it from the sides. This bag is called the <i>amnion</i>;
it is filled with fluid, and protects the embryo from jars. Remove
the amnion and notice the large <i>head</i>; it is now twisted so that
its left side lies against the yolk, while the rest of the embryo
still lies “face-down.” Observe the large <i>eye</i> on the right side of
the head; the left eye cannot be seen without turning the head over.
Notice the <i>heart</i>, a small red dot which by help of a lens can be
seen to beat rapidly. Surrounding the embryo is a circular network of
<i>blood-vessels</i> which bring food from the yolk to the heart, to be
distributed to the various parts of the body. How large is the circular
area of blood-vessels?</p>

<p>6. <b>Chick after three days’ incubation.</b>—The white of the egg is
distinctly shrunken, and the network of blood-vessels is much larger
than before. Remove the amnion and notice the marked increase in size
of the embryo, especially of the <i>head</i>. The right side of the head and
neck are still turned towards the shell. They are now quite free from
the yolk, but the body of the embryo communicates with the yolk by a
short, wide tube, the <i>yolk-stalk</i>. Try to see a small pit, a little
above and behind the large <i>eye</i>. This is the beginning of the right
<i>ear</i>. Measure the embryo and the width of the surrounding network of
blood-vessels. Watch, through a lens, the beating of the <i>heart</i>.</p>

<p>7. <b>Chick after four days’ incubation.</b>—Carefully cut open the
amnion to see the embryo better. Observe that the young chick is still
more completely folded off from the yolk, and that the <i>yolk-stalk</i> is
consequently narrower than before. The head is so strongly bent upon
itself that the snout almost touches the tail. The body also has now
turned over so as to lie with its left side on the yolk. Observe the
two pairs of small buds which are the <i>rudiments of the limbs</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>8. <b>Chick after five days’ incubation.</b>—Cut open the <i>amnion</i>,
and notice the great increase in size of the embryo, and especially
the enormous development of the <i>head</i>. The <i>limbs</i> now show signs of
division into segments. Observe, under the hinder end of the body, a
small, bladder-like outgrowth, the <i>allantois</i>, which in the later
stages grows rapidly and spreads all round the inside of the shell. It
is the breathing organ of the chick.</p>

<p>9. <b>Effect of varnishing an egg.</b>—Varnish an egg, and leave it
under the hen with unvarnished eggs for the whole period of incubation
(21 days). The varnished egg does not develop, because the varnish
closes the pores of the shell and prevents the embryo from breathing.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The early development of the chick.</b>—When the hen’s egg is
exposed to a temperature of about 40°C., the <b>germinal disc</b>—the
circular patch of living matter which lies, somewhat like a small
inverted watch-glass, upon the upper surface of the yolk—grows larger,
and its parts are gradually modified to form the various regions of
the chick’s body. The white and yolk of the egg are used up during the
process, and by the time they are absorbed, the young bird is in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
condition to break the shell and take up the activities of an
independent life. To watch the orderly appearance and gradual
development of the different systems of organs is most fascinating,
and fortunately the observation of the main features presents no great
difficulty if the foregoing instructions are followed.</p>

<p>The first signs of the chick are to be seen (<a href="#FIG_186">Fig. 186</a>),
towards the end of the <b>first day</b> of incubation, in a streak
which crosses the germinal disc in a direction at right
angles to the long axis of the egg. One end of the streak is
distinctly rounded, and this is the <b>head</b> end (<i>hd.</i>). In
almost all cases, if the egg be placed so that its broad end is to the
observer’s left, the head of the embryo will be directed away from him.</p>

<p><b>A day later</b>, the embryo is markedly larger, and is partly
covered by a double membrane called the <b>amnion</b>.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Surrounding the embryo is now (<a href="#FIG_188">Fig. 188</a>) a network of fine blood-vessels which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
ramify over the yolk and carry small particles of yolk to feed the
growing organs. At the end of the second day the network could be about
covered by a sixpenny piece. On each side, its veins join to form a
single small tube running to the <b>heart</b> (<i>ht.</i>), a tiny red dot
which is situated behind the head and can be seen, by the help of a
lens, to be beating rapidly. The head has grown more than the rest of
the embryo, owing to the rapid development of the primitive brain, and
is bent forwards. The head has turned over a little, so that its right
side is directed towards the egg-shell; the rest of the embryo still
lies “face-down.” The right <b>eye</b> (<i>e.</i>) can easily be seen as a
dark spot on the side of the head.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>By the end of the <b>third day</b> (<a href="#FIG_189">Fig. 189</a>) the head and
neck are raised distinctly above the yolk, and the tail is also more plainly
marked off, so that the body is connected with the yolk only by a short
wide tube, the <b>yolk-stalk</b> (<i>yk.st.</i>, <a href="#FIG_187">Fig. 187</a>, <i>B</i>). The neck as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
well as the head has now turned so as to lie with the right side
directed towards the shell. The commencement of the <b>ear</b> is to be
seen on each side as a small pit (<i>au.</i>) a little above and behind the
large eye.</p>

<p>On the <b>fourth day</b> the embryo turns to lie entirely on its left
side. It becomes more completely folded off from the yolk, and the
connecting yolk-stalk is a narrower tube than before. The previously
formed organs increase in size and complexity. The disproportionate
size of the head, owing to the great development of the brain, is still
more marked than before, and the head is so strongly bent upon itself
that the snout almost touches the tail. One of the most noteworthy
features of the fourth day is the appearance of the <b>limbs</b>. As
yet these are merely a pair of small buds (<i>fl.</i>, <i>hl.</i>,
<a href="#FIG_190">Fig. 190</a>), and no joints can be detected in them.

</div>

<p>By the end of the <b>fifth day</b> (<a href="#FIG_191">Fig. 191</a>) the head
is enormous, and the limbs now show signs of being divided into definite segments.
A thin bladder-like structure—the <b>allantois</b> (<i>all.</i>), which
appeared on the fourth day—has grown out from the lower part of the
body, behind the yolk-stalk. Its mode of origin is well shown in <a href="#FIG_192">Fig. 192</a>.
It rapidly increases in size, and soon extends over the embryo
(Figs. <a href="#FIG_192"> 192 <i>B</i></a>, and <a href="#FIG_191"> 191</a>) and becomes
closely applied to the shell-membrane. Air passes through the pores of the shell, and its
oxygen is taken up by the blood which circulates in the vessels of the allantois.
At the same time, waste carbon dioxide is able to escape from the blood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
to the outer air. The allantois is therefore the <b>breathing organ</b>
of the developing chick. If the egg is varnished and the shell thus
rendered air-tight, the embryo dies of suffocation at an early stage.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</p>
</div>

<p>The chief organs of the bird are now established, and the later
development may be sketched more briefly. By the end of the <b>ninth
day</b> (<a href="#FIG_193">Fig. 193</a>) the white of the egg is almost used up;
the yolk, however, is still large, and is connected with the chick’s body by
the narrow yolk-stalk. It thus appears that the white is not directly
absorbed by the chick, but is first taken up by the yolk and afterwards
passed on by the yolk blood-vessels which run to the heart. By this
time, too, the allantois has spread at least halfway round the inside
of the shell, that a supply of oxygen adequate to the increased needs
of the animal may be obtained from the air. The chick has now a
characteristic bird-like appearance; the beak has appeared; feathers
have begun to sprout; the neck is long and slender; and the segments of
the limbs, including the fingers and toes, are well defined.</p>

<p>About the <b>fourteenth day</b> the chick turns so as to lie lengthwise
in the shell, with its head near the broad end. The yolk-sac dwindles
in size, and at last, about the twentieth day, it is drawn into the
interior of the body. Now the chick becomes restless, and—usually
on the <b>twenty-first day</b>—thrusts its beak through the inner
shell-membrane into the air-chamber at the broad end of the egg.
For the first time it draws refreshing air into its lungs, and is
stimulated to break the shell by a knob on its beak, and to creep out
into the world.

<h4>54. THE EDUCATION AND LATER GROWTH OF THE
CHICK.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor"><small>[18]</small></a></h4>

<p>1. <b>Hatching.</b>—On the 20th or 21st day of incubation remove
three or four eggs from the clutch under the hen, and keep them in a
warm cosy place so that you may watch the process of hatching. Can
you hear the chick tapping the inside of the shell? Could it have
been <i>taught</i> to tap? Which part of the shell cracks first? When the
shell has cracked, can you hear the chick chirping? Could it have been
taught to chirp? Imitate the chirp and listen for a response. Keep the
newly-hatched chicks in a warm, soft place. How soon do they recover
from the exhaustion of hatching? Do the chicks show a liking for warm
corners? Are they afraid of being touched gently?</p>

<p>2. <b>Locomotion.</b>—How soon do the chicks begin to run about? Do
they stumble upon obstacles, or do they avoid or leap over them? Do
they use their wings in running, or in jumping down a small step? Put
a chick into a basket, and lower the basket quickly through the air,
being careful not to let the chick fall out. Does it move its wings? How?</p>

<p>3. <b>Feeding and drinking.</b>—Lay a few grains of soaked wheat upon
the ground before a chick which has not yet been fed. Does it peck at
them instinctively? Tap a grain with the point of a pencil; does the
chick now peck at it? Does it hit the grain at the first try? Does it
ever strike at a grain which is out of reach? Watch a hen with her
chicks; does she teach them to peck at food? How? Do the chicks know
instinctively the difference between food and grains of sand, or have
they to learn? Try if a chick can distinguish between a small worm and
a bit of red worsted. Are young chicks afraid of large insects?</p>

<p>Take a chick, which has not yet drunk, to a small pool (a few drops) of
water. Does it seem to know the use of the water? Induce it to peck at
the water; does it now drink? How?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <b>The crouching-instinct.</b>—Clap your hands suddenly and loudly
near young chicks. How do the chicks behave? Does this behaviour render
them less conspicuous?</p>

<p>5. <b>Non-recognition of hen.</b>—Having made the above observations
on chicks hatched apart from the hen, put the chicks among their
brothers and sisters with the parent hen. Do the new-comers respond, as
readily as the others, to the clucking, etc., of the hen?</p>

<p>6. <b>Maternal training and protection.</b>—How many different
meanings can you recognise in the different sounds of the hen’s voice?
How does she call and protect the chicks when any danger threatens them?</p>

<p>7. <b>The voice of the chick.</b>—Notice the different sounds by which
a chick expresses pleasure, alarm, distress, etc.</p>

<p>8. <b>Preening and scratching.</b>—At what age do chickens begin to
preen their feathers, and to scratch the ground? Try to discover if
these are instinctive activities, or whether they have to be learnt
from the hen.</p>

<p>9. <b>Change in plumage.</b>—At what age are the down feathers
replaced by the true plumage? At what age is it possible to distinguish
the young cocks from the young hens?</p>

<p>10. <b>External characters, etc., of adults.</b>—Notice the flowing
tail-feathers, hackles (the long feathers on the neck and loins), comb,
and spurs of the cock-birds, and their absence or small size in the
hens. What differences are there as regards voice? How does the hen
announce that she has laid an egg? Which sex is the more pugnacious?</p>

<p><b>The recently hatched chick.</b>—The newly-hatched chick is clothed
with fine down-feathers (pp. <a href="#Page_273">273</a> and <a href="#Page_277">277</a>).
It is generally exhausted by its struggles to escape from the shell,
but it soon recovers, and is able to run about freely on the second
day after hatching. Young birds which, like the chick, are active
immediately after hatching, are said to be <b>precocious</b>.</p>

<p><b>Instinct and education.</b>—From the first, the chick performs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
certain movements which are obviously <b>instinctive</b>, that
is, which have not been acquired by any process of imitation or
instruction. Even in the egg, it may be heard chirping soon after
it has taken its first breath of air; and the complex activities of
walking, running, jumping over obstacles, and, later, preening the
feathers and scratching the ground—each of which involves the nicest
adjustment of several muscles—are also instinctive. Certain other
powers have to be learnt; the hen, for example, lifts and drops before
the chick a particle of food which she wishes it to seize, and it soon
learns to peck. At first its pecks generally fall a little short of
the objects, but presently it becomes very adroit at catching food.
“A chick a day or so old will catch a running fly at from the seventh
to the twelfth shot.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
There does not appear to be much instinctive recognition of the
difference between objects which are valuable as food and those which
are the reverse. Such discrimination comes only by experience, and to
a very young chick a piece of red worsted and a small worm are equally
attractive before being seized. In the same way, the nature of water
has to be learnt. Chicks peck at drops of water, but do not seem to
know the use of water until their beaks are wetted, when they drink
instinctively in the usual manner.</p>

<p>The use of the wings is also a matter of instinct, but it is acquired
somewhat late, and is assisted by parental encouragement and example
even in birds which are noted for their powers of flight. Fowls do
not fly much, but chicks may be observed to use their wings as an aid
in running or jumping. Prof. Lloyd Morgan<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
quotes an interesting experiment which shows well how deeply the
reliance on flight is stamped in bird-nature. “If a chick a day or two
old be placed in a basket, held firmly in the hand, and then lowered
rapidly through the air, the fledgling will stretch out his little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
immature wings in such an attitude as would make them break the fall
were they fully developed; or will, if he be a little older, flap them
with flight-like action, in either case showing an instinctive response.”</p>

<p><b>Hens and chickens.</b>—Chickens which have been hatched in the
natural manner are, from the first, under the control of the hen (<a href="#FIG_194">Fig. 194</a>),
and her anxious care for their welfare has always been considered
one of the most beautiful examples of the maternal instinct. In their
defence her courage is unbounded; should she discover a succulent
worm or other dainty morsel, her ordinary complacent cluck changes
to a note of invitation, to which the brood at once responds; and at
her danger-signal the chickens run to take refuge under her wings, or
crouch motionless against the ground. The chirp of a chick also is
capable of expressing several states of feeling, such as contentment,
pleasure, alarm, and distress. These different notes are not only
perfectly intelligible to the hen, but are familiar to anyone who has
had experience of poultry.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 194.</span>—Hen and Chickens.</p>
</div>

<p>In the face of these well-known instances of the perfect understanding
between the hen and her chickens, it is somewhat surprising to find
that chickens, hatched apart from the hen and then placed with the
rest of the brood after a few days, at first pay very little attention
to the hen, except for their instinctive tendency to nestle into warm
places, and do not seem to understand her clucks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Adult fowls.</b>—The down-feathers are soon shed and replaced by
the true plumage, and the chicken gradually takes on the appearance
of the adult. A marked difference is generally to be seen between the
cocks and hens (<a href="#FIG_195">Fig. 195</a>) of any breed of poultry. The
cock is usually provided with flowing tail-feathers, hackles (elongated feathers
on the neck and loins), a prominent comb, and “spurs”—features which are
either absent or much less perfectly developed in the hens. As great
differences exist between the voices of the two sexes, the crow by
which the pugnacious male challenges his rivals, and the cackle of the
hen when she has laid an egg, being familiar examples.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"> SOME FAMILIAR BRITISH BIRDS.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>55. THE THRUSH FAMILY.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The song-thrush, mavis, or throstle.</b>—Throstles are to be
seen throughout the year. Take every opportunity of observing their
habits, and make careful notes of these at the time. Especially attend
to the following characters:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>General appearance.</i>—What is the average size of the
bird? What is the length of the tail? At what angle is the tail held? Does
the bird move it in any special manner? What is the prevailing colour
of the body? Notice the light-coloured and spotted breast. Compare the
male and female as regards size, colouration, etc.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Habits.</i>—What situations do throstles chiefly inhabit? Do
they keep near the edge of the wood, or have you often seen them inside
thick woods? Does the bird hop, or walk, when on the ground? Upon what
does it feed? Have you ever seen it cracking the shell of a snail?
If you find a heap of snail-shells near a stone, watch, at a little
distance, for the throstle coming to crack snail-shells on the stone.
Does it also eat worms, or fruit? Describe a throstle’s beak. How would
you describe the flight—as high or low, swift or slow, straight, in
wide curves, or undulating? Does the bird perch on trees? How does it
use its toes in perching?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Song.</i>—In what months does the throstle sing? Does it sing
late at night and early in the morning? How does it compare with other birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
in this respect? In what positions have you seen the bird singing—when
flying, perching, or on the ground? Try to write down the syllables
which seem to you most like the throstle’s song, and notice how the
phrases are repeated. Notice that throstles sing less during August
than in autumn. Listen, in September or October, for young thrushes
learning to sing, and contrast their efforts with the song of the adult birds.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The nest.</i>—At what time of the year do throstles pair and build
their nests? In what situations have you found the nests? Write a
description of the shape, size, and materials of the first throstle’s
nest you find. Visit it frequently, try not to disturb the birds, and
note the dates of laying of the eggs. How many eggs are laid? What
are their size and colour? How are they arranged in the nest? Do the
broad or the narrow ends point inwards? What are the advantages of this
arrangement (i) for purposes of packing, (ii) when the eggs hatch? Do
both birds sit on the eggs? If only one, which? What is the time of
incubation?</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The young.</i>—Are the young birds naked and helpless, or
feathered, at hatching? How do the parent-birds feed them? What is the
appearance of the fledglings? In what respect do they (i) resemble,
(ii) differ from, the parents? How long do the birds remain in the nest
after hatching? Write an account of any education you have observed
them to receive from the parents.</p>

<p class="blockquot2 no-indent">{Make similar observations and notes on other
birds, in addition to the special observations mentioned below, and
learn to recognise their appearance, flight, song, nest, and eggs. A
field-glass will be found of great assistance.}</p>

<p>2. <b>The missel-thrush, or storm-cock.</b>—Compare the missel-thrush
with the song-thrush. Notice its larger size, the brighter colour of
its spotted breast, and its somewhat less musical song. Listen for its
song during, or immediately after, a storm, even in winter. In the
nesting season observe the marked courage and pugnacity of the bird.</p>

<p>3. <b>The blackbird.</b>—Compare the blackbird with the thrushes in
respect of appearance, food, habits, and song. Notice the difference in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the colouration of the male and female blackbird. Observe that the
young bird has a spotted breast like that of a thrush, but that old
blackbirds are not spotted. Have you noticed a blackbird show a
preference for singing in any particular place? What observations would
lead you to suppose that the blackbird is a near relative of the thrushes?</p>

<p>4. <b>Fieldfares.</b>—Distinguish these birds from thrushes. Notice
that they arrive about October, and frequent fields in large parties.</p>

<p><b>The thrush family.</b>—For many reasons the thrush family forms a
convenient starting point in the study of the habits of common British
birds. It includes some of our very finest songsters and therefore most
popular birds; many of its members are abundant in most parts of the
country, so that nearly every student has the opportunity of observing
them at first hand; the birds are not specially shy; and, lastly, the
family affords excellent material for the method of comparison and
contrast, which, be it repeated, is the essence of all sound work in
nature-study.</p>

<p>The <b>song-thrush</b>, which is also known as the <b>throstle</b>
and <b>mavis</b>, is a shapely bird, easily recognisable by its grey,
spotted breast (<a href="#FIG_196">Fig. 196</a>), which may be seen all the
year round in wooded parts of the country. The male and female are very similar
in appearance, and of almost equal size, measuring 8 or 9 inches from
head to tail. The thrush generally feeds on the ground, hopping along
on a pair of sturdy legs and feet, seizing and pulling out worms
which incautiously show themselves at the mouths of their burrows,
and catching insects and snails. A thrush usually has a favourite
stone on which it cracks the shells of snails, and it is not uncommon
to find, near the stone, a little heap of broken snail-shells—the
remains of many a feast. In winter, when the summer diet can no longer
be obtained, the thrush subsists largely upon the fruit of hawthorn,
mistletoe, etc. Its beak, as is usual with birds, is distinctly adapted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
to the capture of its food, being, in this case, narrow, round, and
fairly long. The thrush is a strong and rather rapid flier.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_196" id="FIG_196"></a>
    <img src="images/i_304.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="382" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 196.</span>—Song-Thrush. (×&nbsp;⅙).</p>
</div>

<p>Thrushes begin to sing at the first signs of spring, pairing and
commencing the work of nest-building in February or early March.
The throstle’s song is surpassed by very few birds; and many people
consider it equal, if not superior, to the nightingale’s. The song
begins before sunrise, and may be heard when almost all other birds
have retired to rest. The thrush has a curious habit of repeating
each strain two or three times, “lest,” as Browning says, “you should
think he never could recapture the first fine careless rapture.” Many
attempts have been made to imitate the song by words; Mr. R. Kearton<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
quotes with approval the following rendering by the famous Scottish
naturalist Macgillivray:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Qui qui qui kweeu quip,</span>
<span class="i1">Tiurru tiurru chipiwi,</span>
<span class="i1">Too-tee, too-tee, chiu choo,</span>
<span class="i1">Chirri chirri chooee</span>
<span class="i1">Quiu qui qui.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
But, as Mr. Kearton remarks, “no human words can ever represent,
especially in cold type, the passionate vehemence, the sprightliness,
or the tender pleading of a thrush’s song.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_197" id="FIG_197"></a>
    <img src="images/i_305.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="367" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 197.</span>—Nest of Song-Thrush. (×&nbsp;⅓).</p>
</div>

<p>The nest of the thrush (<a href="#FIG_197">Fig. 197</a>) is a massive structure,
deep and cup-shaped, and open at the top. It is built of small twigs and grass,
and is plastered with mud or cow-dung until the inside is smooth and
hard. It is usually placed in an evergreen bush or tree, but may
also be found in cavities in tree-trunks or in holes in walls, or
even in sheltered places on the ground. The eggs number from 4 to 6;
they are about an inch long, are sky-blue in colour, and marked with
black spots, which are most numerous near the thick end. The eggs are
arranged with their pointed ends inwards; this method not only allows
them to be packed more closely together and therefore to be more easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
covered by the sitting bird, but is also of convenience at the time of
hatching, as the young birds usually emerge (<a href="#Page_294">p. 294</a>) at
the thick end. The eggs hatch after a fortnight’s incubation. The young thrushes
are at first blind, almost naked, and are quite helpless. They make rapid
progress, however, and are sufficiently fledged to leave the nest in
about a fortnight after hatching. The fledgling throstle (<a href="#FIG_198">Fig. 198</a>)
is lighter in colour than the adult, and much more distinctly spotted.
In October the young birds may be heard learning to sing; their first
efforts are hesitating and uncertain, but by tireless practice and
careful imitation of the old birds they presently come into full
possession of their delightful powers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 198.</span>—Young Song-Thrushes in Nest.</p>
</div>

<p>The <b>missel</b>, or <b>mistletoe</b>, <b>thrush</b> (<a href="#FIG_199">Fig. 199</a>)
much resembles the song-thrush in appearance and manner of life, but is
distinctly larger, measuring about 10½ inches from head to tail. It has
a very pleasing song, which may be heard, even in the depth of winter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
when all other song-birds are mute. The missel thrush’s habit of
singing vigorously during storms has led to its alternative name
of “<b>storm-cock</b>.” The bird is noted for its pugnacity in the
breeding season, and for the courage with which it defends its nest
and young; any other birds approaching the nest are promptly attacked
and driven to a distance. The nest is generally built in a tree, where
a branch springs from the trunk. It is made of dried grass, moss, and
wool, and the hen lays from 4 to 6 pale-green eggs, which are speckled
with brown.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 200.</span>—Blackbird (Hen). (×&nbsp;⅙.)</p>
</div>

<p>The <b>blackbird</b> (<a href="#FIG_200">Fig. 200</a>) may easily be distinguished from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
thrush by its colour—the male being black, with a yellow beak, and
the female blackish brown, slightly mottled below. The blackbird is
slightly larger than the thrush, but in shape and habits the two
birds are very similar; they haunt the same woods, live upon similar
food (<i>i.e.</i> worms, insects, snails and, in winter, fruit) and
build their nests in similar situations. The blackbird’s song is,
however, quite distinctive, and consists of mellow, flute like notes,
without the repetition which is so characteristic of the throstle and
missel-thrush. The blackbird is fond of perching, when singing, upon a
bare branch which commands a good view of the surroundings. The nest
(<a href="#FIG_201">Fig. 201</a>) is much like that of the song thrush, but the
inside has a soft lining of fine grass instead of being hardened with mud. The
4, 5, or occasionally 6 eggs are bluish-green in colour, and are marked with
<i>blurred</i> brown spots.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_201" id="FIG_201"></a>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 201.</span>—Blackbird’s Nest.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Curiously enough, young blackbirds, like young thrushes, are very
distinctly spotted. There can be no doubt that blackbirds and thrushes
are descended from the same stock, and that their ancestors had spotted
breasts. For some reason, the blackbird has lost its family colours,
although, as is so often the case among animals, it is still compelled
to bear the marks of its ancestry during its infancy. Young blackbirds
also receive a musical education from their parents, and may often be
heard practising their song in September or October.</p>

<p>The <b>fieldfare</b>, another near relative of the thrush, arrives
in this country about the beginning of October, and stays with us
for the winter, returning in spring to its nesting places among the
pines and firs of Norway. The general colour of the bird is grey,
with reddish-brown on the wings, and its breast is speckled in the
thrush-manner. Fieldfares frequent fields in large parties, especially
in the evenings, but are readily alarmed.</p>

<p><b>Other birds of the thrush family.</b>—The redwing, wheat-ear,
whin-chat, stone-chat, redstart, robin, nightingale, and hedge-sparrow
are other members of the thrush family which can here be only referred
to. They have many points of resemblance, one of the most interesting
of which is that the young birds are invariably spotted. The bill
is usually rather long, stout, and straight, the staple food being
insects, worms, etc., though fruit is also eaten, especially in winter.
The nests are typically cup-shaped, and the eggs greenish or blue, with
or without spots. The young birds are quite helpless and almost naked
when hatched, and can only open their mouths to be fed by the parents.
Even after they have left the nest they need careful and continuous
teaching by the parents before they can be made to understand that in
future they will have to obtain their own food. Birds of this family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
on account of the variable character of their food, are not so markedly
migratory as many others, although they generally move further
southward in winter, as the supply of insects becomes scarce—their
place being taken by birds which have spent the summer in more
northerly regions. This habit is very obvious in the case of the
fieldfare and redwing, which visit us for the winter and return to
Norway and Sweden for the summer. The nightingale, on the other hand,
arrives here from the south in April to build its nest and rear its young.</p>

<h4>56. THE SWALLOW FAMILY, THE SKYLARK, AND CROWS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The swallow.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>General appearance.</i>—Notice, first of
all, the bird’s colouration, as this readily distinguishes the swallow
from the martins. The whole of the upper surface is steel-blue; the
only white is on the ventral surface. A black band stretches across
the breast; the throat and forehead are pink. Observe the long, deeply
forked tail, and the broad, short bill.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Habits.</i>—What are the earliest and latest dates on which you
have seen swallows? Do the birds seem to prefer the neighbourhood of
water? Have you ever seen them (i) perching on trees, (ii) on the
ground? Why do swallows occasionally alight on the ground? Do they seem
comfortable on the ground? Observe the small and weak feet; are these
adapted to a terrestrial life? Do swallows feed on the ground? What do
they eat? How are the insects caught? What is the advantage of the very
wide gape? How would you describe the flight of the swallow?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Voice.</i>—Does the swallow sing? Describe its voice. Have you
heard it when the bird was on the wing, or only when it was at rest?
What kind of sound is uttered by the swallow when it is alarmed or angry?</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Nest.</i>—In what situations have you found swallows’ nests? (Do
not confuse the nest with that of the house-martin, which lays white,
unspotted eggs.) How soon after their arrival do the birds begin to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
build? What is the shape of the nest? Of what materials is it composed?
How many eggs does it contain? What is their colour?</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Young.</i>—Look for the newly-hatched young about the last week in
June, and describe their appearance. How soon after hatching do they
leave the nest? Do they at once feed themselves, or are they fed by the
parents? Keep the nest under observation after the young birds have left it,
and notice whether the old birds rear another brood the same summer.</p>

<p>In September look for the annual congregation of swallows which
precedes their departure for Africa.</p>

<p>2. <b>The house-martin.</b>—Distinguish the house-martin from the
swallow by the patch of white on the upper tail-coverts (<a href="#FIG_179">Fig. 179</a>),
and by the feathered toes. Make notes of the dates of arrival and departure
of the birds. Do house-martins occupy old nests or build fresh ones?
What are the position, material, shape, and size of the nest? How
does it differ from the swallow’s nest? Is the martin of sociable or
solitary habits? Watch the birds building new nests or repairing old
ones, and describe the process. Examine and count the pure-white eggs.
What are the newly-hatched young like? How many broods have you known
one pair of martins to rear in one season? Have you ever known martins
to be turned out of their nests by sparrows? Watch for the autumn
congregation.</p>

<p>3. <b>The sand-martin.</b>—Notice the small size of the bird, the
mouse-colour of the upper parts, and the black feathers of the wings
and tail. Note the dates of arrival and departure. Is the bird often
seen near houses? Look for the nesting-holes in cliffs, banks, etc.
Examine the holes, and notice that they lead into tunnels which slope
slightly upwards. What is the use of the slope? If possible examine the
nest at the end of the tunnel, and compare it and the eggs with those
of the swallow and house-martin. Observe the peculiar jerky flight.
Does the bird sing? Describe its voice.</p>

<p>4. <b>The skylark.</b>—Does the skylark frequent woods or open ground?
Describe the appearance, size, and colouration of the bird, and try to
see the long toes. Especially notice the long claw of the hind-toe.
Have you ever seen the bird perching on trees or bushes? Are the feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
well adapted for perching? Does the skylark run or hop? In what month
does it begin to sing? In March look for larks’ nests in hollows and
ruts of fields. What are the materials of the nest? Describe the number
and appearance of the eggs. Listen to the song, and try to say in
what respects it differs from that of other birds. Does the bird sing
only when flying, or also when on the ground? Describe the skylark’s
flight, and study its method of soaring (<a href="#Page_278">p. 278</a>). Observe
that the birds collect into flocks in autumn. Do they leave the country for
the winter? How do they spend the winter? Do they sing in winter? If
possible examine the beak; for what kind of food do you think it best
adapted?</p>

<p>5. <b>The rook.</b>—Notice the size, shape, and colouration of the
bird. Do rooks live merely in pairs or in large communities? Do they
build on the ground or in trees? Are the trees high or low? What is the
largest number of rooks’ nests you have seen in one tree? Watch the
birds repairing and building nests in February and March. Of what are
the nests composed? Have you ever seen rooks stealing sticks from other
rooks’ nests? Are the birds quarrelsome? Where do they feed? Do they
hop or walk? Do they keep together when feeding? Do all the birds of
one rookery feed at the same time, or do some remain in the trees? Why?</p>

<p>What is the shape of the beak? How is this associated with the food of
the bird? Do the farmers in your neighbourhood consider rooks useful
or the reverse? Why? What is the voice of the rook like? How does it
vary to express warning, anger, etc. Describe any observations which
lead you to suppose that a colony of rooks has a code of laws. Describe
the flight of the rook; what other birds fly in a somewhat similar
manner? In spring, look beneath the trees for the broken shells of eggs
which may have fallen from the nests. What is their colour? Describe
the appearance and habits of the young birds. Where do rooks spend the
winter? Have you ever seen them visiting and inspecting their nests in
winter?</p>

<p>6. <b>Other birds of the crow family.</b>—With the rook compare and
contrast the crow, raven, jackdaw, magpie, and jay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
<b>The swallow family.</b>—Swallows and martins are popular with all
lovers of birds, for many reasons. Their arrival is welcomed as visible
evidence of the approach of summer; their graceful and rapid flight
delights the eye; their obvious liking for the neighbourhood of human
dwellings wins our sympathy; and, lastly, they claim our gratitude by
their incalculable services in keeping down insect pests.</p>

<p>The <b>swallow</b> (<a href="#FIG_202">Fig. 202</a>) may readily be distinguished
from the martins by the absence of white from its upper parts, which are glossy
and of a steel-blue colour. The forehead, chin, and throat are of a
pink or chestnut colour; the ventral surface is white, with a black
band crossing the neck. The tail is long, and very deeply forked. The
bill is short and broad, and the gape stretches nearly to the eyes—a
great advantage to a bird living on insects which are caught flying.
The feet are very small and weak, but as the swallow spends most of its
time in the air, and rarely alights on the ground except to collect
materials for its nest, it does not need very sturdy hind-limbs, and
the feet are chiefly used for perching.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 202.</span>—The Swallow. (×&nbsp;¼.)</p>
</div>

<p>Swallows arrive in this country about the middle of April, and about a
month later proceed to build their nests in the chimneys of houses and
on the rafters of barns and outhouses. The nest is basin-shaped and
open at the top; it is chiefly composed of mud, which the birds collect
on the ground, place in position, and allow to dry. Short straws are
used to bind the mud together, and the nest is lined with soft grass
and feathers. The hen lays from 4 to 7 eggs, which are a translucent
white, with reddish-brown or grey markings. The first brood of young
is usually hatched about the end of June, but a second or even a third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
brood may be raised before the parents depart for the south. Gilbert
White<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
gives the following charming account of the training of young
swallows: “For a day or two they are fed on the chimney-top, and then
are conducted to the dead, leafless bough of some tree, where, sitting
in a row, they are attended with great assiduity, and may then be
called <i>perchers</i>. In a day or two more they become <i>flyers</i>, but
are still unable to take their own food; therefore they play about near
the place where the dams are hawking for flies; and, when a mouthful
is collected, at a certain signal given, the dam and the nestling
advance, rising towards each other, and meeting at an angle; the young
one all the while uttering such a little quick note of gratitude and
complacency, that a person must have paid very little regard to the
wonders of Nature that has not often remarked this feat.” When the
young bird has learnt to feed itself “it at once associates with the
first brood of house-martins; and with them congregates, clustering on
sunny roofs, towers, and trees.... All the summer long is the swallow a
most instructive pattern of unwearied industry and affection; for from
morning to night, while there is a family to be supported, she spends
the whole day in skimming close to the ground, and executing the most
sudden turns and quick evolutions.... When a fly is taken a smart snap
from her bill is heard, resembling the noise at the shutting of a watch
case; but the motion of the mandibles is too quick for the eye.”</p>

<p>The swallow drinks whilst flying, sipping the water from the surface
of pools. Its song is a delicate and pleasing warble, which is uttered
both at rest and during flight. The voice becomes a squeak when the
bird is alarmed or angry. Just before the autumn migration, swallows
perch in crowds on roofs, hedges, and the branches of trees. They leave
for Africa about the beginning of October.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>house-martin</b> may be distinguished from the swallow by the
patch of white upon the upper tail-coverts, and by its feathered toes.
Like the swallow, it arrives in this country about the middle of
April. The birds soon begin to repair their old nests and to construct
new ones under the eaves of houses. The nest is largely composed of
clay or mud, which the birds collect from damp places in the road,
etc., place in position against the wall, and allowed to harden. The
completed nest is somewhat bag-shaped, having only a small hole at
the top; it is lined with soft grass. The eggs are white, without
spots. It is worthy of notice when a wild bird lays white eggs, they
are hidden from sight by the shape or position of the nest, as in the
case of the martins, or the nest is built in an inaccessible place.
Exposed eggs are usually made more or less inconspicuous by being
coloured or spotted. House-sparrows (<a href="#FIG_208-209">Fig. 208</a>) have often
been known to expel the defenceless martins from their nests, and to lay their
own eggs therein. The eggs of the sparrow may be recognised by their grey
colour, and by the brown blotches with which they are marked.</p>

<p>The structure of the martin, like that of the swallow, is admirably
adapted to a life in the air, and to a diet of flying insects—the
bird having powerful wings, small and weak feet, and a soft and short
but widely-opening beak. House-martins leave us about the beginning of
October.</p>

<p>The <b>sand-martin</b> is distinctly smaller than either the swallow
or house-martin, and it may be further distinguished from them by
the “mouse-colour” of its upper parts. It usually arrives in this
country about a fortnight in advance of its two relatives, and also
departs before them, leaving in August or September. These birds live
in colonies in tunnels which they excavate in banks or friable cliffs
(<a href="#FIG_203">Fig. 203</a>)—generally in the near vicinity of water. The excavation may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
be three feet in length; it slopes slightly upwards to the nest (which
is placed at the end of the tunnel), in order that rain water may not
collect in it. The eggs are pure white, and five or six in number. The
birds are exclusively insectivorous; they do not sing, but utter a
little twitter. The flight is very characteristic, consisting of “odd
jerks and vacillations, not unlike the motions of a butterfly.”</p>

</div>

<p><b>The skylark.</b>—At the first glance, it is obvious that the
skylark (<a href="#FIG_204">Fig. 204</a>) is adapted for a life spent largely upon
the ground. The large toes lie flat on the earth, and the long claw of the hind toe
is plainly not very suitable for grasping the twigs of trees in the act
of perching. In fact, the skylark only occasionally perches, on low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
bushes. Walking or running on the ground, it lives upon grubs,
caterpillars, flies, worms, etc., and also upon seeds, which its
strong beak enables it to extract from the husks. The body is brown,
the wings being streaked with black, and the dull-white throat and
breast being marked with brown spots—a colouration which is a
considerable protection. The nest is built in March, in a hollow or
rut on the ground; it is lined with dry grass. The four or five eggs
are greenish-grey, and spotted with brown. Whilst the hen sits upon
her eggs (<a href="#FIG_205">Fig. 205</a>) the cock-bird either hunts for food
or sings his delightful song as he soars in the air. The wonderful powers of
soaring of this bird have already (<a href="#Page_278">p. 278</a>) been referred
to. When the lark drops to the ground he alights at a little distance from the
nest, and then runs up to it through the grass. By this device he avoids
revealing the position of his mate and young.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Skylarks rarely sing in the depth of winter; in autumn they form
large flocks which patrol the fields until spring in search for
food—rendering incalculable services to mankind by the destruction of
insect-larvae. During the coldest weather of winter the birds crouch
under banks and hedges.</p>

<p><b>The rook.</b>—The rook (<a href="#FIG_206">Fig. 206</a>)—often called the
crow—is a rather large bird, measuring about 17 inches from head to tail. Its
plumage is black, but as it becomes adult the feathers covering the
face and nostrils are shed, leaving the skin of these parts bare.
The bird has long and pointed wings, and is a strong flier. The bill
is stout and almost straight. Rooks are no songsters, their harsh
“caw” being destitute of musical qualities. When heard at a distance,
however, the cry “becomes a confused noise or chiding; or rather a
pleasing murmur, very engaging to the imagination, and not unlike the
cry of a pack of hounds in hollow, echoing woods, or the rushing of the
wind in tall trees, or the tumbling of the tide upon a pebbly shore.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

            (×&nbsp;¹&frasl;₁₀.)</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most interesting features of rook-ways is the habit of
living in organised communities.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
It is true that a primitive form of social life is found among
swallows, martins, and (in winter) larks, reminding us of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
gregarious habits of the rabbit (<a href="#Page_211">Chapter XII.</a>) among mammals;
but a rook-society is rather to be compared with the pack-life of the wild
dogs (<a href="#Page_252">p. 252</a>), which depends for its integrity upon the
observance of certain rules of conduct by its members. Naturalists have long
known that such a code of laws is in force in every rookery, but what
these laws are we do not fully understand. Here is a profitable and
interesting field of observation for the student. It has sometimes
been observed that certain birds are prevented by the rest from
building until the nests already commenced are finished, and cases
have been known of birds being expelled from the rookery, or even
put to death, after a consultation or “trial,” presumably for some
breach of law. On the other hand, it must be admitted that rooks are
generally arrant thieves, not scrupling to rob their neighbours’ nests
of building-materials to save themselves trouble. They are also very quarrelsome.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 207.</span>—Rooks’ Nests in Trees.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
The nests are built on high trees (<a href="#FIG_207">Fig. 207</a>); they are
composed of sticks and turf, and are lined with moss and soft grass. As each of
several adjacent trees often contains a large number of nests, a sort
of rook-town called a “rookery” is formed. This is added to from year
to year, as the number of the birds increases. During the summer the
rookery forms the headquarters of the community, but about August or
September, before the leaves are shed, the birds leave their nests, to
spend the winter in thicker or evergreen woods, often at some distance.
At intervals during the winter they revisit their spring nests. They
come back to the rookery in February or March, and at once set about
repairing old nests or building new ones. The male bird begins to feed
the female even before the bluish-green eggs are laid, and is a pattern
of domestic virtue throughout the period of incubation. For some time
after hatching, the young birds are fed by the parents. Rooks feed on
the ground in flocks, a few birds remaining behind in the trees as
sentinels to give the alarm when danger threatens. The food consists
very largely of the larvae of injurious insects, especially the grubs
of the cockchafer beetle, and although the birds undoubtedly eat corn
and other young crops, they do far more good than harm.</p>

<p><b>Other birds of the crow family.</b>—The crow, raven, jackdaw,
magpie, and jay are so similar in many respects to the rook and to each
other that naturalists include them all in one group, which they call
the crow family.</p>

<p><b>The passerine order.</b>—The <i>families</i> of the birds hitherto
considered in this chapter, with the flycatchers, wrens, chats, tits,
finches, linnets, starlings, etc., are further grouped together to form
what is called an <i>order</i>. The order which consists of these families
derives its name <b>passerine</b> from the sparrow<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
(<a href="#FIG_208-209">Fig. 208</a>), perhaps the commonest of the birds included in it. It is probably in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
this order that bird structure attains its most perfect development.
Again, the birds of the crow family are generally considered to
stand at the head of the order; if this view is correct, rooks must
be regarded as occupying, among birds, a position which roughly
corresponds to man’s place in the class of mammals.</p>

<p>Passerine birds are nearly all singers, and their toes are generally
adapted for perching. They feed upon insects, seeds (especially the
seeds of grasses), and soft fruit. Their beaks vary in form according
to the nature of the food upon which they most depend, as is well shown
by the soft, widely opening bills of the swallows, the strong but
slender beaks of the thrushes, larks, and crows, and the short, hard
beaks of such seed-eaters as the canary, sparrow, and other finches.
Birds which are exclusively, or almost exclusively, insectivorous are
compelled to migrate to warmer countries to obtain food during the
winter. The eggs of passerine birds are usually coloured or spotted,
and the young birds are hatched in a helpless and almost naked
condition, being carefully tended and fed by both parents until they
are able to fend for themselves. A few familiar birds of other orders
will now be briefly considered.</p>

</div>

<h4>57. THE SWIFT AND THE CUCKOO.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The swift.</b>—Distinguish the swift from the swallow by its
larger size, its sooty black colour (except for the dull white of the
throat), and its long, bowed wings. In what respect does the swift
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
resemble the swallow? Watch for the appearance of swifts about the end
of April. Do the birds arrive singly, in pairs, or in flocks? Notice
the rapid turns and twists of the flying bird. Does it as a rule fly
near the ground, or at somewhat great heights? Have you ever noticed
the bird perching, or settling on the ground? Have you seen it clinging
to walls with its feet? Were these the walls of houses or barns, or of
high towers? What actions would lead you to suppose that the nests are
built in high towers? Are more swifts to be seen in the evening, or
during the day? Can you explain this? Watch during the first half of
August, and make a note of the day on which swifts were last seen.</p>

<p>2. <b>The cuckoo.</b>—What is the earliest date on which you have
heard the cuckoo? Imitate the cry by putting your hollowed hands
together and blowing between the thumbs. With practice you will be
able to deceive the bird into thinking that another cuckoo is present,
and it will approach near enough to be seen distinctly. Estimate the
size of the bird, and write down a careful description of its form,
colouration, and method of flight. Try to see that two of its toes
point forwards and two backwards. Have you ever seen cuckoos mobbed by
small birds?</p>

<p>Carefully examine as many nests of small birds as possible, and try to
find one containing an egg slightly larger than the rest and perhaps
differently coloured. This will probably be a cuckoo’s egg. Visit the
nest at frequent intervals, both before and after the hatching of the
eggs, and write descriptions of the eggs, the appearance and size of
the young birds, what becomes of each, and the behaviour of the old
birds. What is the latest date on which you have heard the cuckoo?</p>

<p><b>The swift.</b>—Though the swift bears a strong general resemblance
to the swallow, the two birds are not at all closely related, but
belong to different orders. The swallow, like all other passerine birds
(<a href="#Page_320">p. 320</a>), has 12 tail-feathers, and its first toe is separately
movable and directed backwards. The swift, on the other hand, has only 10
tail-quills, and all its toes point forwards. There are, however, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
obvious differences, which readily enable one bird to be distinguished
from the other, even at a distance. The swift is, with the exception
of a dull-white patch on the throat, of a sooty black hue over all the
body, and in flight its long and powerful wings take the form of a bent
bow (<a href="#FIG_208-209">Fig. 209</a>). The swallow flies in bold, sweeping curves,
while the more rapid swift turns sharply in the air, in pursuit of the flying
insects upon which it feeds, in a manner suggestive of the flight of a
bat. While, again, the swallow flies much near the ground, the swift
is usually seen at greater heights. The harsh scream of the swift is,
moreover, in marked contrast with the swallow’s pleasing song.</p>

<p>Swifts do not willingly alight on the ground, even to collect materials
for their nests, nor do they perch on trees or roofs, the arrangement
of their toes being quite unsuitable for either action, and the length
of the wings being such that, even with toes of the normal type,
walking would be almost impossible. The nest, a somewhat rude structure
of grass and feathers, is generally built in high towers or other tall
buildings. The eggs are two in number; they are more conical in shape
than those of the swallow, and, as the position of the nest renders
them independent of protective colouration, are white. The hen-bird
sits on them during the day, but generally leaves the nest and flies
abroad in the evening to hunt for insects. Only one brood is reared,
and the birds take their departure early in August, to spend the winter
in South Africa or Madagascar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
<b>The cuckoo.</b>—The cuckoo is placed by naturalists, not among
the passerine birds, but in the order to which the swift belongs.
The reasons for this cannot be fully considered here, but it may be
mentioned that the cuckoo has only 10 tail-feathers, and that it
differs from all passerine birds in having its fourth toe, as well as
the first, directed backwards, the second and third pointing forwards
(<a href="#FIG_210">Fig. 210</a>).</p>

<p>The cuckoo has a total length of about 14 inches. The upper surface
of the body, and the throat, are grey; the rest of the lower surface
is white, crossed with black bars. The wings are large and powerful,
and the thighs are covered with long feathers. In general appearance,
as well as in manner of flight, the cuckoo bears a great resemblance
to a hawk, which may perhaps be the reason why small birds so often
join forces and attack it. A keen-eyed observer will, however, at once
distinguish the birds by the head and the bill, both of which are
markedly longer in the cuckoo than in the hawk. Cuckoos arrive here
in April, the males usually appearing first. The well-known call, to
which the bird owes its name, is uttered by the male only; the voice of
the female is quite different, and is often compared to the sound of
bubbling water. The cuckoo feeds entirely upon insects; it is believed
to be the only bird which eats the hairy caterpillar of the tiger-moth
(<a href="#Page_369">p. 369</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 210.</span>—The Cuckoo,
          (×&nbsp;¹&frasl;₇.)</p>
</div>

<p>Of all bird-habits, probably none has excited more interest than the
manner of life of the young cuckoo. Its parents build no nest, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
depend entirely upon other birds for rearing their offspring. The
female cuckoo lays her egg upon the ground and then carries it in her
bill to a nest which contains similarly coloured eggs, if such a nest
is to be found. If not, another convenient nest is selected. It is said
that the male sometimes renders assistance by distracting the attention
of the rightful owners in the meantime. In most cases the owners of
the nest, apparently unaware of the trick, sit upon the strange egg
with the rest, and in due course the young birds are hatched. The young
cuckoo, whilst still blind and naked, wriggles itself under its foster
brothers and hoists them over the edge of the nest. Far from resenting
the crime, the duped parents now devote their energies to feeding the
murderer, and continue their attentions until after it is fully fledged
(about a fortnight after hatching) and perhaps several times their
combined size.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

           (Cuckoo’s Egg on the right).</p>
</div>

<p>The small size of the cuckoo’s egg—about one-fourth of what might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
expected from so large a bird—and its general similarity in colour to
their own eggs, both aid in deceiving the victimised birds in the first
instance, and the disproportionate size of their supposed offspring
shortly after hatching apparently does not arouse their suspicions. It
is believed that any particular female cuckoo lays only eggs of one
type and deposits them, as far as possible, in nests of the mimicked
species—the species, probably, by which she herself was reared.
During the summer, therefore, she visits one such nest after another,
until she has disposed of all her eggs. Further, it is supposed that
her offspring inherit her tendency to lay eggs of the particular
colour, and therefore to prey in their turn upon the species of their
foster-parents. In this country, the meadow pipit, pied wagtail,
robin, and reed-warbler are perhaps the most usual victims of the
cuckoo’s parasitism, but the nests of other species (<a href="#FIG_211">Fig. 211</a>)
are not uncommonly selected.</p>

<p>The old cuckoos depart about the end of July, apparently leaving the
young ones to find their way south alone.</p>

<h4>58. THE DUCK.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Tame ducks.</b>—Closely observe ducks, both on land and
when they are swimming. Where is the heaviest part of the body? Are
the legs attached in front of, directly below, or behind the centre of
gravity? Is the position of the legs an advantage or a disadvantage
(i) in walking, (ii) in swimming? How does the foot differ from the
feet of the birds previously mentioned? Between which toes is the
web stretched? How are the toes held when the bird lifts its foot in
walking? Does it walk gracefully? How does it swim? Are the legs moved
together or alternately in swimming? Notice how the web folds up when
the foot is moved forwards, and spreads out for the back-stroke. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
does the duck eat? How is the food obtained? Why are a duck’s feathers
so little wetted by the water? Watch, and describe exactly, how the
bird preens its feathers.</p>

<p>How can you distinguish the male (drake) from the female duck, (i) by
appearance, (ii) by the voice? Do the colours of the drake’s plumage
differ at different periods of the year? What relation have the changes
of plumage to the moulting-season? What differences can you observe in
the methods of moulting of ducks and fowls? Is there any time of the
year when (i) ducks, (ii) fowls are unable to fly? Why? When and where
do ducks lay their eggs? Describe the appearance of the eggs. Are young
ducks helpless or precocious (<a href="#Page_296">p. 296</a>), naked or clothed,
at hatching? Can they feed themselves? Can they swim?</p>

<p>Examine a dead duck. Notice the thick covering of down-feathers next
the skin. What is its use? Examine and draw a foot, and see how the web
folds between the toes. Observe the soft, sensitive skin on the outside
of the beak; what do you suppose is its use? Notice the shape of the
beak. Open it to see the horny plates fringing its inner edge, and
notice how these, with other plates on the thick, fleshy tongue, form a
strainer.</p>

<p><b>The duck.</b>—The birds of the duck order—which includes also
the geese and swans—differ in many important respects from all our
previous types, and it is interesting to observe how perfectly these
differences are adapted to the manner of life. On land, the ungainly
waddle, which is entailed by the insertion of the hind limbs so far
back on the body (<a href="#FIG_212">Fig. 212</a>), shows that the duck is not
in an entirely congenial element; in the water the bird is a model of graceful
movement, perfectly balanced, progressing smoothly by alternate strokes
of its webbed feet, and altering its course to any desired direction
with the utmost ease. The duck feeds largely upon the small animals
which abound in the water of ponds, and in the mud of the sides, and
the beak is beautifully fitted for the duties it has to perform. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
covered on the outside by a soft and highly sensitive skin, which
enables the bird to detect with certainty the presence of its prey
in the mud; the inner edge of the beak is provided with horny plates
which, with similar plates situated on the edge of the thick, fleshy
tongue, form a very efficient strainer, by means of which the useless
water and thin mud can be forced out at the sides of the mouth and
separated from the worms, etc., which were taken into the mouth at the
same time. A thick coat of down-feathers, which lies next the skin and
contains a great deal of entangled air, forms a non-conducting layer
which prevents the undue escape of the heat of the body, and saves the
bird from becoming chilled when in the water. Ducks are, moreover,
careful to keep their feathers well oiled, and may often be seen
preening themselves—applying the bill alternately to the oil-gland on
the tail and to the feathers. The completeness with which water flows
off a duck’s back is proverbial.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
During the greater part of the year the brilliant plumage of the drake
forms a striking contrast to the sober brown and grey feathers of the
female. Another point of difference is that in the male the four middle
tail-feathers are curled upwards. From July to October, however, before
the moult takes place, the two sexes are very similar in appearance.
Birds of the duck order moult in a somewhat different manner from most
other birds, in that all the quill-feathers are shed at once, instead
of in pairs. Until the new feathers develop, flight is of course out
of the question, and the birds remain as secluded as possible in the
meantime.</p>

<p>The eggs are white and greasy-looking; they are laid in a rough,
open-topped nest, lined with down, which is placed on the ground.
The wild duck covers up the eggs when she leaves the nest. The young
are active immediately after hatching. It has been noticed that the
eggs of precocious birds are generally larger, in proportion to the
size of the parent, than those of birds which are naked and helpless
at hatching—the larger store of egg-food allowing a more complete
development of the young bird in the shell. Further, the nests of
precocious birds are, as a rule, less elaborately constructed.</p>

<h4>59. TWO COMMON HAWKS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The sparrow-hawk.</b>—Watch for sparrow-hawks near farms. Notice
the general resemblance of the bird to the cuckoo, but distinguish
them by the short head and beak of the hawk. Observe the <i>bluish-grey</i>
colouration of the upper parts. Describe the flight of the hawk and, if
possible, its method of catching its prey.</p>

<p>2. <b>The kestrel or windhover.</b>—Distinguish the kestrel from the
sparrow-hawk (i) by the <i>reddish</i> colour of its upper parts, and (ii)
by its habit of hovering in mid-air. Have you ever known the kestrel to
prey upon small birds? Upon what does it feed?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The sparrow hawk and kestrel.</b>—These two birds are the only
British hawks which the average nature-student is likely to see during
a country walk; and as one of them is given to preying on young
game-birds, chickens, etc., while the other as generally confines
itself to animals which are universally regarded as vermin, it is
important to be able to distinguish them at sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_213" id="FIG_213"></a>
    <img src="images/i_330.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="344" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 213.</span>—The Nest of the Sparrow Hawk.</p>
</div>

<p>The <b>sparrow-hawk</b> (<a href="#FIG_213">Fig. 213</a>) attains a length of 13
inches; the female is slightly larger than the male. The upper parts of the body
are <i>bluish-grey</i> in colour; the lower parts are buffish white, and
crossed with brown bars. The head is short and round; the bill is
hooked and sharp, as in birds of prey generally, and the toes are armed
with sharp claws. The bird is often to be seen near farms, lurking
behind hedges and waiting for an opportunity of dashing upon chickens
or other small birds and carrying them off.</p>

<p>The <b>kestrel</b>, which in size and shape much resembles the
sparrow-hawk, is really a species of falcon (<a href="#FIG_179">Fig. 179</a>).
It is unrivalled among common British birds in its power of remaining poised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
in one position in mid-air by that rapid motion of the wings which
is called hovering, a power which has earned for it the name of
“windhover.” The kestrel, though in reality one of the farmer’s best
friends, from its wholesale destruction of field-mice, voles, and many
injurious insects, is often ignorantly confused with the sparrow-hawk.
The <i>reddish</i> hue of the plumage of the kestrel’s upper parts, together
with the hovering habit, ought to render such a mistake impossible to
observant eyes, and to secure the bird from a persecution which may
reasonably be directed against the sparrow-hawk.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"> FROGS AND TADPOLES.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>60. THE LIFE OF THE FROG.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Manner of life.</b>—Where have you found frogs? Are they
commonest in dry or in damp situations? At what time of the year have
you seen them actually in water? How do frogs move about? Do they walk
or hop? Chase a frog, and notice that its hops become shorter as it
is pursued. Upon what does the frog feed? Have you ever seen frogs
abroad in the depth of winter? Are insects common in winter? How do you
suppose frogs spend the winter? What are the principal enemies of frogs?</p>

<p>2. <b>External characters.</b>—Catch a frog; is its body dry or moist?
Does it feel cold or warm? How does it behave when caught? Does it soon
become tame if well treated? Put a frog under an inverted pickle-bottle
and observe it carefully. What is its <i>size</i>? What was the size of the
smallest frog you have seen? At what time of the year can the smallest
frogs be seen? What is the <i>colour</i> of the frog? Put one frog with
dark-coloured leaves and soil, and another with light-coloured leaves,
and try to find out if the skin of the first becomes lighter and that
of the second darker in colour. Is it an advantage to the frog to be
able to change slightly in colour? Why? What is the position of the
frog when at rest? Notice the shortness of the body, the hump on the
back, the relative lengths of the limbs, the 4 unwebbed fingers, the 5
webbed toes, and the absence of a tail. What is the advantage of the
long hind-limbs? Mention other leaping animals whose hind-limbs are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
longer than the fore-limbs. Is a short-bodied animal (<i>i.e.</i> one with
its four limbs pretty close together) less likely to be injured by
the fall, after a leap, than a long-bodied animal? Why? Put the frog
into water, and watch it swim. What is the use of the webs between the
toes? Examine the <i>head</i>. Notice the very wide stretch of the mouth,
the small openings of the nostrils, the large prominent eyes, and the
ear-drum—a dark-coloured disc on each side, a little below and behind
the eye.</p>

<p>3. <b>Breathing.</b>—Watch the up-and-down movements of the floor of
the mouth, by which the animal pumps air, through its nostrils, in and
out of its mouth-cavity.</p>

<p>4. <b>Method of feeding.</b>—Put live insects, small worms, etc.,
under the upturned bottle enclosing the frog, and watch the animal’s
method of feeding. Try to see how it uses its tongue. What is the
advantage of the wide gape of the mouth? Can you get the frog to accept
dead insects?</p>

<p>5. <b>The inside of the mouth.</b>—To kill a frog painlessly, soak
about a teaspoonful of chloroform on cotton wool, and put it with the
frog under a bottle or tumbler. After 15 or 20 minutes the frog will be
quite dead.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>).—Open the jaws widely, and examine the inside of the mouth.
Notice how the rounded <i>eyeballs</i> project into the mouth-cavity when
they are pressed from the outside. Pass your finger-end round the
margins of the jaws, and feel the row of fine <i>teeth</i> borne by the
upper jaw; the lower jaw is destitute of teeth. Feel also, in the roof
of the mouth, two small patches of teeth (<i>Vo.</i>, <a href="#FIG_216">Fig. 216</a>);
these are carried by small bones called the vomers, and are therefore called the
<i>vomerine teeth</i>. Just to the outside of the vomerine teeth and in
front of the eyeball, notice on each side the internal opening of the
<i>nostril</i> (<i>Ch.</i>, <a href="#FIG_216">Fig. 216</a>); pass into one nostril
a stiff bristle, and observe that it emerges at the external nostril. Pull forward
the <i>tongue</i> (<i>T</i>, <a href="#FIG_216">Fig. 216</a>) and observe that it is
attached at its front end; feel how sticky the tongue is. Behind the eyes, and at the
angles of the jaws, notice the openings of the Eustachian tubes (<i>E</i>,
<a href="#FIG_216">Fig. 216</a>); push a stiff bristle into one and observe,
from the outside, that the end of the bristle presses the inner surface of the ear-drum.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>).—If the roof of the mouth has dried, moisten it with water, and
place a very small cork-shaving or a tiny snip of paper on it, far back
between the eyeballs. Notice that the shaving travels slowly down the
throat. This experiment ought to be made soon after the frog has been killed.</p>

<p>6. <b>The bones.</b>—Feel, through the body-wall, the various parts
of the skeleton, making out the skull, backbone, limb-bones and their
manner of attachment, and breast-bone (protecting the heart). Observe
the <i>absence of ribs</i>.</p>

<p>7. <b>The skin.</b>—Examine the skin of the dead frog, and notice that
it is <i>damp</i> or even somewhat slimy, and that it differs from the skin
of a mammal or bird in being <i>naked</i>, bearing neither hairs, feathers,
nor scales. Pinch up the skin, and notice how very loosely it is
attached to the underlying body-wall. Snip through the thin skin, turn
it back from the body-wall, and see the network of <i>blood-vessels</i> upon
its inner surface.</p>

<p><b>The habits of the frog.</b>—The common grass frog (<a href="#FIG_214">Fig. 214</a>)
is to be found in abundance, from early spring to October, in ditches, marshy
land, and other damp places. As winter approaches, frogs generally
bury themselves in the mud at the bottom of ponds, etc., and remain
there in a state of torpor until the spring, when they emerge and the
females lay their eggs. Frogs are said to be “cold-blooded” because
their temperature never varies much from that of their surroundings.
Birds and mammals, on the other hand, maintain an almost constant
temperature,—a healthy man’s blood, for example, being just as warm
in the depth of winter as it is on a hot summer day. So long as they
are not actually frozen hard, therefore, frogs can endure the winter
cold without much inconvenience. Although the frog is essentially a
land animal, it is quite at home in the water, and swims gracefully and
easily by the help of the webs which connect the long toes of its hind
feet. On land, it progresses by long leaps, its limbs and body being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
well adapted to this habit. As is usual in leaping animals, the
hind legs and feet are markedly longer than the fore limbs; and the
shortness of the body enables the two pairs of limbs to be brought
together to break the shock of the fall.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_214" id="FIG_214"></a>
    <img src="images/i_335.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="440" />
    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 214.</span>—The Frog. (×&nbsp;1.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Food.</b>—The frog’s method of catching its prey is very
interesting, and is graphically described by Dr. Hans Gadow<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
as follows:—“The food, which consists chiefly of insects, snails,
and worms, must be moving to excite interest; then the frog, whose
favourite position is half squatting, half supported by the arms,
erects itself and, facing the insect, turns round upon its haunches,
adjusts its position anew by a shifting of the legs, and betrays its
mental agitation by a few rapid movements of the throat. All this time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
the prey is watched intently until it moves; then there follows a jump,
a flap of the tongue, and the insect is seen no more.” This flap of
the tongue is well illustrated in <a href="#FIG_215">Fig. 215</a>. The frog’s
tongue is free behind, but is attached, by its anterior end, close to the middle
of the lower jaw,—an arrangement which enables it to be flicked out to
its full length. Further, it is covered by a glutinous secretion, which
sticks tenaciously to the prey.</p>

<div class="figleft">
    <a name="FIG_215" id="FIG_215"></a>
    <img src="images/i_336.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="341" />

        <span class="smcap">Fig. 215.</span>—Three Stages of<br />
        the Movement of the<br />Tongue of a Frog. (×&nbsp;1.)
</p>
</div>

<p>The frog is fortunate also in the extremely wide gape of its mouth,
which stretches, almost literally, from ear to ear. Once in the mouth,
the captive is prevented from escaping by the teeth. Of these there
are two sets; a row of fine teeth is present along the greater part of
the margin of the upper jaw, and, in addition, two small patches of
teeth—the vomerine teeth (<i>Vo.</i>, <a href="#FIG_216">Fig. 216</a>)—occur on
the roof of the mouth. Fairly large insects are promptly gulped down into the stomach;
those which, owing to their minute size, escape being swallowed in the
ordinary manner, are slowly but surely forced down the throat by the
incessant lashing of thousands of tiny threads—too small to be seen
except by high powers of the microscope—which are carried by the skin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
of the roof of the mouth. The action of these invisible threads
may easily be seen if a frog’s mouth be opened widely and a small
cork-shaving be placed near the top of the throat (Expt. <b>60</b>, 5,
<i>b</i>). The shaving steadily travels backwards and is soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that frogs and toads are of
incalculable value in keeping down insect pests, and deserve systematic
protection for this if for no other reason.</p>

<p><b>How a frog breathes.</b>—When a resting frog is watched, the floor
of the mouth is seen to be raised and lowered alternately. It is a
common belief among children that these movements are a sign that the
animal is “getting ready to spit.” Frogs do not spit, however, and the
action is simply a part of the breathing process, which is performed
in the following manner. The mouth being closed, the nostrils are
opened, and, by alternate up-and-down movements of the floor of the
mouth, the air present in the mouth-cavity is completely replaced by
fresh air. The nostrils are then closed, and the slit-like glottis
(<i>gl.</i>, <a href="#FIG_163">Fig. 163</a>) which leads to the lungs (<i>l. lng.</i>, <i>r. lng.</i>)
is opened. The foul air is forced out of the lungs and mixed with the pure
air in the mouth-cavity. Then, immediately, the floor of the mouth
is raised—pumping the mixed air into the lungs—and the glottis is
closed. In the <b>lungs</b> an exchange takes place between the oxygen
of the refreshed air, and the surplus carbon dioxide in the blood which
is circulating in the capillaries (<a href="#Page_242">p. 242</a>) of the walls
of the lungs. In the meantime the nostrils have again been opened, and the first
stages of the process are already being repeated.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

      vomerine teeth. (×&nbsp;1.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
A considerable part of a frog’s breathing is carried on, in these
first stages, through the thin membrane forming the <b>roof of the
mouth-cavity</b>. This is richly supplied with blood capillaries,
and is therefore admirably adapted for the exchange of gases which
constitutes respiration. Moreover, the <b>skin</b> covering the general
surface of the body has also a very abundant blood-supply, and forms
yet a third respiratory organ; so that it is practically impossible
to drown a frog in ordinary water—in water, that is, which contains
dissolved air. This power of breathing through the skin is of great
importance to a frog during the winter sleep at the bottom of a pond.</p>

<p><b>The frog’s skin.</b>—The frog’s skin is kept moist by a slimy
fluid which is continually being discharged from small glands in
its substance. The moisture not only facilitates skin-breathing as
described above, but its evaporation keeps the body cool even in
hot weather—a matter of vital importance to an animal to which a
temperature of 40° C. or so is fatal. A third most interesting property
of the frog’s skin is its power of changing somewhat in colour to match
the colour of its surroundings. The change depends upon an alteration
in form and size of certain small brown specks imbedded in the
thickness of the skin. When the animal finds itself in dark-coloured
surroundings these specks enlarge, and the skin as a whole takes on a
darker hue. On a light background the reverse change takes place.</p>

<p><b>A case of evolution.</b>—The advantage which accrues to a frog
from being thus rendered less conspicuous to enemies and prey alike
is obvious, and there is no difficulty in picturing to ourselves the
probable manner in which the advantage was developed. Widely different
races of animals have colour-specks in the skin, and we may assume
that frogs and their ancestors have possessed such spots for countless
generations. Now suppose that, ages ago, a frog happened to be born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
with the power of altering very slightly the size of his colour-specks.
If this power rendered him less conspicuous, in however slight a
degree, than his neighbour frogs he would, other things being equal,
be more likely than they to escape from enemies, grow to maturity, and
in due course have sons and daughters. All his offspring, and they
might number thousands, would tend to inherit, to varying extents, the
power of changing colour. In some—perhaps in most—the power would be
practically absent; in others it might be equal to that of the parent;
while in a few instances it would probably be greater. In any case,
those frogs of the second generation which had the greatest power of
changing their colour would be the most likely to survive the keen
struggle for existence and therefore to leave offspring. The survival
of the “fittest” frogs of each generation, and the transmission to
the next generation, in ever-increasing intensity, of their favouring
accomplishment, would naturally result at last in the production of
a race of animals in which, as in the frogs of to-day, the power of
changing colour is universal.</p>

       the left side, showing inflated vocal sacs. (×&nbsp;1.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>The laying of the eggs.</b>—About the end of March the frogs resort
in great numbers to shallow ponds and ditches, pair with much croaking,
and the females lay their eggs or “spawn.” Both sexes croak, and the
male of the edible frog, though not of the common grass frog, is able
to make more noise in virtue of a pair of vocal sacs (<a href="#FIG_217">Fig. 217</a>),
which he can inflate with air from the mouth (<a href="#FIG_216">Fig. 216</a>), and
which act as resonators. After spawning, the frogs leave the water, abandoning the
eggs to their fate, and resume their ordinary terrestrial life, until
approaching winter prompts them to hide in the mud and go to sleep.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<h4>61. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FROG.</h4>

<p>1. <b>A simple aquarium.</b>—A simple aquarium, in which the
development of the frog from the egg may be watched, is easily made.
Obtain a fairly large basin, and cover the bottom with sand, mud, and
stones from a pond. Arrange these so that the bottom shall shelve from
the surface of the water at one side to a depth of 3” or 4” at the
other. Put in some stones covered with green slime, which will almost
certainly be found in the pond, plant a few water-weeds, and allow the
water to clear.</p>

<p>2. <b>Frog spawn.</b>—Having prepared the aquarium, obtain, towards
the end of March (or earlier in a mild spring) a handful of frog
spawn from a pond or ditch. It forms a mass of jelly in which the
true eggs—small balls about ¹/₁₀” in diameter—are imbedded. Put
this in the aquarium and examine it carefully every day, making the
observations described below. If possible, obtain a pair of spawning
frogs, and place them in a bucket with a little water, so that the
earliest stages also may be studied.</p>

<p>3. <b>The eggs before hatching.</b>—Observe the globe of jelly which
surrounds each egg. Try to pick it up between your finger and thumb. Do
you think it is of any use in protecting the eggs from being eaten by
fishes, birds, etc.? Remove the jelly as completely as possible from
one egg, put the egg in a watch-glass with a little water, and examine
it carefully with a strong lens. To which of the stages shown in <a href="#FIG_218">Fig. 218</a>
does it correspond? If possible, treat a newly-laid egg in the same
manner and examine it every hour or so through the day. Make notes of
the time elapsing between the various stages shown in <a href="#FIG_218">Fig. 218</a>.</p>

<p>4. <b>Hatching.</b>—Notice that the developing eggs change from the
spherical to the ovoid form. What is the shape when the embryo begins
to move? Notice the appearance of a neck and a tail. At this stage the
embryo makes its way out of the jelly, or hatches. The jelly may now
be thrown away, as it is of no further use. How does the embryo behave
immediately after hatching? Put one in a watch-glass and with a lens try
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
to see the <i>sucker</i> by which it attaches itself to water-weeds, etc.</p>

<p>5. <b>Tadpolehood.</b>—Examine the tadpoles at frequent intervals by
the help of a lens, and write careful accounts of the changes which
take place in them. Notice particularly the fine threads—the external
<i>gills</i>—which grow out from the sides of the neck. How many are there?
After a time they shrivel up and are replaced by other gills which
cannot be seen. Write a description of a tadpole at the time when it
begins to feed. How large is it?</p>

<p>Count the tadpoles in the aquarium at intervals of a few days,
carefully removing all dead ones. Supply fresh green slime from the
pond from time to time. Have you any reason to suppose that tadpoles
are cannibals?</p>

<p>How soon do the tadpoles come to the surface to breathe air? Describe
the appearance of one when it begins to do this. Has it any legs? How
many can you see? In what order do the legs grow out?</p>

<p>Notice now the dwindling of the tail. (It does not drop off, as is so
often stated.) The tadpole has become a frog. What percentage of the
original eggs have developed into frogs?</p>

</div>

<p><b>The early development of the frog’s egg.</b>—A frog’s egg is a
little spherical mass about one-tenth of an inch in diameter. When
laid, it is covered by a thin gelatinous layer which soon swells
up in the water to form a transparent globe of about half-an-inch
diameter, in the centre of which the true egg can be seen. This jelly
is extremely slippery and difficult to grasp, and is consequently
an efficient protection against the attacks of birds, fishes,
insect-larvae, etc., and even of parasitic fungi and other small
organisms. The jelly also acts as a float. At the time of laying,
each egg consists of a black and a white portion. In the lower, or
white, part there is a store of food, on which the little embryo subsists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
until it acquires a mouth and begins to fend for itself. The
development begins in the upper, or black, part of the egg, and may
easily be watched with a lens. And to be appreciated properly, the
changes should be watched, and not merely read about. The student
should get, if possible, some freshly-laid frog’s eggs, and remove the
gelatinous investment from one or two. It will require care to do this
without injuring the eggs. They should now be put, with a little fresh
water, into a watch-glass, and carefully examined at intervals of half
an hour or so. Soon a little pit makes its appearance in the middle of
the black half, and gradually extends until it becomes a groove, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
little by little reaches quite round the egg (<a href="#FIG_218">Fig. 218</a>, <i>A</i>).
In the meantime another groove begins to form at right angles to the
first, and, in its turn, grows down round the egg (<i>B</i>). If we compare
the whole egg to the earth, and the middle of the black half to the
North Pole, these two grooves may be said to be along meridians at
right angles to each other. The third groove (<i>C</i>) may be considered as
along a parallel of latitude, but it is somewhat to the north of the
Equator. These first three grooves deepen until the whole egg is cut
up into eight separate pieces. The sight of the apparently lifeless
speck dividing itself up in this regular and orderly manner, “while
you wait,” is an intellectual treat which should not be missed. The
cleavage of the egg goes on rapidly, but in a less regular manner now,
until the whole is cut up into a hollow sphere of segments (<i>F</i>), black
and small (<i>mi</i>) in the northern hemisphere, whitish and larger (<i>mg</i>)
in the south.</p>

<p>It is worth while to pause here to consider how these early changes are
assisted by the peculiar condition of the egg at the time of laying.
The southern hemisphere of the egg is laden with a store of food. The
food is dead, and acts as a mechanical hindrance to the activity of
the living matter. In the northern half of the egg but little food
is present to impede its activity, and it is plainly important that
this half shall receive as much warmth as possible from the uncertain
sunshine of early spring. Two circumstances ensure this. In the first
place, the food-laden region is the heaviest part of the egg, so that
the latter—buoyed up as it is by the jelly—tends to float with its
most “alive” part upwards. Secondly, this upper part is coloured
black,—a great advantage, since black objects absorb heat readily.
Both these peculiarities therefore favour the more rapid development of
the “northern” hemisphere. Hence the third cleft is to the north of the
egg’s equator, instead of being halfway between the upper and lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
poles, and hence, too, at the close of segmentation the northern
segments are smaller and more numerous than the southern. In the case
of the hen’s egg (<a href="#Page_282">Chapter XVI.</a>), the amount of stored
food contained in the egg (the yolk) is so enormous that segmentation is confined
entirely to a small patch on the upper surface. Another result of the
relatively small amount of stored food in the frog’s egg is that the
tadpole is compelled to turn out and earn its own living at a stage
when the chick’s inherited fortune is still considerable.</p>

<p><b>The tadpole.</b>—The spherical mass soon becomes ovoid, and is
divided into head and trunk by a neck-constriction (<i>J</i>). An occasional
wriggle shows that the creature is alive. Shortly afterwards a tail
grows out from the hinder end of the trunk, giving the animal something
of the appearance of a fish (<i>L</i>). In this stage the tadpole makes its
way out of the jelly, and thus hatches, about a fortnight after the
laying of the eggs. The little creature is quite helpless; it has no
mouth (the egg food is not yet exhausted, however), and its attempts at
swimming are still feeble and uncertain. In this defenceless condition
(<a href="#FIG_219">Fig. 219</a>, 1) it will be seen to attach itself to the water-weed
of the aquarium by means of a sucker (<a href="#FIG_218">Fig. 218</a>, <i>L</i>, <i>sk</i>)
on the underside of its head. It is in a very favourable position for examination, and by
help of a lens, two—soon there are three—pairs of fine, thread-like
outgrowths can be distinguished on the sides of the neck (<a href="#FIG_219">Fig. 219</a>,
2 and 2<i>a</i>). These are the <b>external gills</b>. In a few days the mouth
breaks through, and the animal begins to nibble at the vegetation with
little horny jaws, and soon swims about the aquarium with confidence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

       life-history, from the newly-hatched Tadpoles (1) to the young Frog
       (8). (×&nbsp;1.) 2<i>a</i> is a magnified view of 2.</p>
</div>

<p>The gills are the organs by which the young tadpole breathes, and
each little gill-thread is seen, when viewed with a low power of the
microscope, to contain tiny loops of blood-vessels. Every time the
tadpole uses his jaws, wags his tail, or, in short, does anything at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
all, he uses up some oxygen and produces some carbon dioxide. The water
of the aquarium contains dissolved oxygen—green water-weeds are kept
in aquaria for the express purpose of liberating oxygen (<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>)—and
this oxygen makes its way through the excessively thin membrane which
divides the blood of the gills from the water, to be swept away by the
current of the blood to the various parts of the body. The carbon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
dioxide produced is brought to the gills by the blood stream, and
passes through the membrane into the water, where it is utilised by
the water-weed as food (<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>). Animal and plant
are thus mutually serviceable.</p>

<p>A series of slits soon opens through the sides of the neck, and
along their margins are formed folds which are usually called the
<b>internal gills</b>. The external gills dwindle and shrivel up as the
internal gills are being formed, and at the same time a flap of skin
grows backwards from each side of the head and covers over the slits
so that they cannot be seen. Presently the two flaps fuse at their
edges—except at one point on the left side, where a spout is left—and
so enclose a chamber. The water which enters the tadpole’s mouth pours
through the gill-slits, into the chamber, and out through the spout. As
it swills over the folds of the internal gills there is an exchange of
carbon dioxide for oxygen in the manner just described.</p>

<p>The tadpole in the meantime is growing strong and active, and the tail
has grown out to form a powerful organ, the sinuous motion of which
propels the animal with relatively great speed through the water.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the biologist, perhaps the most interesting
feature of this stage of tadpolehood is the almost entire
correspondence of the structure with that of a fish, although the
adult frog is not in any sense a fish. This curious state of things
is explained by supposing that frogs have descended from fish-like
ancestors, and that every frog, in the course of its development, is
under the necessity of repeating, in a more or less modified manner,
the chief stages of its ancestral history. As Marshall happily
expressed it,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
a frog during its development climbs up its own genealogical tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
<b>The metamorphosis.</b>—Just as the external gills are
replaced by internal gills, so these, in their turn, are
replaced by <b>lungs</b>, and advanced tadpoles frequently come
to the surface of the water to breathe air. Limbs have now
grown out from the sides of the body, and the webbed hind
feet considerably assist the tail in swimming. Changes take
place in nearly all the internal organs, fitting the animal for
its life on land; and these changes are so extensive that
there is necessarily a short period when the creature is
neither tadpole nor frog, and is incapable of feeding. The
tail, however, which would be useless to the terrestrial, leaping
frog, is gradually <b>absorbed</b>, and forms a store of nutriment
during the transformation.</p>

<p>The gills shrivel up, and the slits close; the outer layer
of the skin (including the horny jaws) is thrown off, the
hind limbs lengthen, and the animal leaves the water—a frog.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"> THE HABITS AND LIFE-HISTORIES<br />
OF COMMON INSECTS.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>62. THE COCKROACH: A TYPICAL INSECT.</h4>

<p>1. <b>Habits.</b>—In what places have you seen cockroaches? Are they
often to be seen during the day, or do they, in general, come forth
only at night? What is the colour of the body? Put a live cockroach
under a tumbler, and watch its movements. In what position is the head
held? Notice the long <i>feelers</i>; how are they used? Look at the lower
part of the head, and try to see the <i>palps</i>, which resemble small
feelers. How many legs has the cockroach? Watch the rhythmical movement
of the hinder part of the body. Soak a small piece of bread in milk or
water, and put it under the tumbler; watch the cockroach feed. How does
it use the palps? Notice that the jaws move from side to side. How does
the insect clean itself?</p>

<p>2. <b>External characters.</b>—Put a cockroach into a test-tube, and
dip the tube into boiling water; this kills the insect instantly.
Notice the thin “shell” which covers the outside of the animal. Make
out that the body consists of (<i>a</i>) <i>head</i>, carrying the eyes, feelers,
and jaws; (<i>b</i>) <i>thorax</i>, carrying the wings and legs; and (<i>c</i>)
<i>abdomen</i>. Examine them in turn.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>The head.</i>—Notice the vertical position, the black,
kidney-shaped <i>eyes</i>, the <i>feelers</i>, the “upper” lip (<i>labrum</i>),
and the small, blackish <i>mandibles</i> at the sides of the labrum. Pass your
knife-point close behind the labrum and into the mouth, and see the
“lower” lip (<i>labium</i>), which lies behind the knife, <i>i.e.</i> behind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
mouth. Cut off the head and carefully strip off the labium. Put it on a
sheet of paper and examine it with a lens, comparing it with <a href="#FIG_222">Fig. 222</a>
(<i>Mx.</i> 2). Examine the same head from behind with a lens and see the
pair of <i>first maxillae</i>. Notice how they are attached to the head, and
then remove one and compare it with <a href="#FIG_222">Fig. 222</a> (<i>Mx.</i> 1).
Work one of the mandibles backwards and forwards with the point of a pin, and then
remove it and examine it with a lens to see the toothed inner margin.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The thorax.</i>—Notice the overlapping fore-wings (<i>wing-covers</i>).
Pull them aside with forceps; notice that they are narrow and rather
stiff, make out their points of attachment at the corners of the second
segment of the thorax, and then cut them off with scissors. Pull out
the delicate <i>hind-wings</i> in the same way, carefully noticing their
fanlike method of folding, and their points of attachment to the
corners of the third segment of the thorax. Stretch one out, cover it
with a piece of glass to flatten it, and then draw it, marking the
lines of folding. (Notice that some cockroaches of the common species
found in kitchens are destitute of wings, and have only very small
wing-covers. These are females.) After removal of the wing-covers and
wings, the three segments of the thorax are very distinct. Notice that
each segment bears a pair of <i>legs</i>. Take off one of the legs and draw
it. How many joints has it? What is the use of its bristles?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The abdomen.</i>—Observe the line which runs along the dorsal
middle line of the abdomen; this marks the position of the <i>heart</i>.
Examine the method of telescoping of the segments of the abdomen, and
the soft membrane which connects the dorsal and ventral plates of each
segment. Notice that the abdomen bears neither wings nor legs. Observe
the pair of short palp-like bodies (<i>cer.</i>, <a href="#FIG_223">Fig. 223</a>)
at the end of the abdomen, and between them, in the male, a pair of more slender
styles. In the female observe the boat-shaped “<i>brood-chamber</i>”
(<a href="#FIG_223">Fig. 223</a>, <i>st.</i> 7), on the ventral surface.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The spiracles.</i>—In the thin membrane between the dorsal and
ventral plates, at the junction of two abdominal segments, look for a
small hole (spiracle) leading into the interior of the body. How many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
abdominal spiracles can you find on each side? Observe the two larger
spiracles on each side of the thorax, between the first and second, and
the second and third legs.</p>

<p><b>What is an insect.</b>—The word insect is so commonly applied to
animals having no claim whatever to the title, that it is advisable to
point out at once some of the features which distinguish insects from
other animals with which they are often confused. Insects, spiders,
crustaceans, centipedes, and their near relatives, all have jointed
bodies and legs, which are covered by a continuous suit of armour of
a substance called <b>chitin</b>. In some cases, as in lobsters and
crabs, this is for the most part hardened by mineral matter to form a
stout shell, being soft and flexible only at the joints where ease of
movement is required. In other cases the layer of chitin may remain
thin and delicate, and all gradations between the two extremes may
be found. Though soft where movement of one part on another takes
place, the chitin is always firm enough, elsewhere, not only to form
a protection for internal organs, but also to afford attachment
to the muscles which move the body and limbs. It is therefore a
<b>skeleton</b>, but as it is on the outside of the body it is called
an <i>exoskeleton</i>, to distinguish it from the internal skeleton (p.
224) of the vertebrata. Animals such as insects, spiders, centipedes,
and crustaceans, which have jointed bodies and legs, and are covered
by a chitinous exoskeleton, are called <b>arthropods</b>. Insects may
be at once distinguished from all other arthropods by the <i>single</i>
pair of feelers and the <i>six</i> legs. Many of them, but not all, possess
wings—structures which are found in no other arthropods. Insects are
always air-breathers when adult.</p>

<p><b>The cockroach.</b>—The cockroach is not a general favourite, but
it displays so well the essential features of insect structure that
it affords an excellent introduction to the study of the more popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
members of the class, which in many respects are highly specialised. It
is also easily obtained, and of fairly large size.</p>

<p>The body of the cockroach (<a href="#FIG_220">Fig. 220</a>) is very distinctly divided into
three regions: (1) the head (<a href="#FIG_221">Fig. 221</a>) which carries the feelers, the
eyes (<i>ey.</i>) and the jaws (<i>man.</i>, <i>max.¹</i>,
and <i>max.²</i>); (2) the thorax, separated from the head by the
slender neck, and bearing the legs and the wings; and (3) the abdomen,
which bears neither jaws nor limbs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_220" id="FIG_220"></a>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 220.</span>—Cockroach,
         male, seen from above. (×&nbsp;1.)</p>
</div>

<p>The <b>head</b> (<a href="#FIG_221">Fig. 221</a>) hangs nearly vertically from the
neck. The large, compound <b>eyes</b> (<i>ey.</i>) are somewhat kidney-shaped; the
long, jointed <b>feelers</b> are set in sockets just below the eyes.
The front of the head is smooth and rounded; hinged on its lower edge
is a flap which hangs down in front of the mouth, and is called the
<i>labrum</i> or upper lip. Just behind the labrum, and attached to the side
and front plates of the head, is the first pair of <b>jaws</b>, the
<i>mandibles</i> (<i>man.</i>, <a href="#FIG_221">Fig. 221</a>; <i>Mn.</i>,
<a href="#FIG_222">Fig. 222</a>); they work from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
side to side, and their inner edges, which bite against each other, are
strongly toothed. The second pair of jaws, called the <i>first pair of
maxillae</i> (<i>max.¹</i>, <a href="#FIG_221">Fig. 221</a>;
<i>Mx.</i> 1, <a href="#FIG_222">Fig. 222</a>) is
situated behind the mandibles. Each first maxilla consists of a
two-jointed base and two branches; the inner branch bites against
the inner branch of the first maxilla of the other side, while the
outer and longer branch forms the <i>maxillary palp</i>, which acts as a
small feeler. The two <i>second maxillae</i> (the third pair of jaws) are
broadly like the first maxillae, but are partially fused to form the
<i>labium</i> or lower lip (<a href="#FIG_222">Fig. 222</a>, <i>Mx.</i> 2), which
hangs down behind the mouth. The outer branches of the second maxillae are called the
<i>labial palps</i> (<i>Lab. Pa.</i>). It is well to acquire clear notions of
the arrangement of the jaws in the cockroach, in order to understand
the great modification which the mouth-parts of many other insects
have undergone. It is important to notice that the jaws of all arthropods
work from side to side, not vertically as do the jaws of vertebrates.</p>

</div>

<p>The <b>thorax</b> consists of three segments, each of which bears a
pair of <b>legs</b>, upon which the weight of the resting or walking
insect is supported. It has been found, by instantaneous photography,
that in a walking insect the weight is carried at any instant by the
first and third legs of one side and the second leg of the other side.
At the next step the body is carried by the remaining three legs. In
the American (<a href="#FIG_220">Fig. 220</a>) and German cockroaches both sexes possess two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
pairs of <b>wings</b>, which are fixed at the front angles of the
second and third segments of the thorax. The hind-wings, which alone
are used in flight, are folded up fanwise when not in use, and are
covered by the smaller fore-wings, which are generally called the
<b>wing-covers</b>. In the common cockroach of this country, only
the male has well developed wing-covers and wings. In the female the
wing-covers remain small, while the wings themselves have disappeared.</p>

</div>

<p>The <b>abdomen</b> consists of ten segments, although only eight can be
clearly seen without dissection. The “telescopic” arrangement of the
segments is well shown in <a href="#FIG_223">Fig. 223</a>. Where one segment joins
the next, the chitin remains thin and flexible. In each segment the chitin forms
a dorsal (<a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a>) and a ventral plate, which are joined together at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
sides by a flexible membrane. The chitinous covering of the upper
surface of the abdomen is so transparent that the <b>heart</b>, a
median tube, may be seen through it.</p>

<p><b>How an insect breathes.</b>—If the sides of the abdominal segments
be carefully examined, a small aperture will be seen perforating the
thin layer of chitin between the dorsal and ventral plates, at the
point where each segment joins the next; and, in the thorax, larger
but similar openings will be found on each side between the first
and second and the second and third legs. These holes are called
<b>spiracles</b> (<a href="#FIG_223">Fig. 223</a>, <i>spir.</i>); they lead into a
complex system of air-tubes which ramify throughout the whole system and supply the
organs with oxygen. The tubes are prevented from collapsing by a spiral
lining thread of chitin. This peculiar method of respiration, which
is characteristic of insects, should be carefully contrasted with the
manner of breathing in a rabbit or a man (<a href="#Page_242">p. 242</a>) and in
a tadpole (<a href="#Page_344">p. 344</a>). It ought to be borne in mind, however,
that the essence of respiration is the same in all living things, and consists in a
replacement of excess carbon dioxide by fresh oxygen (<a href="#Page_242">p. 242</a>);
the difference lies merely in the manner of effecting the exchange. In the
rabbit, the blood, carrying the excess of carbon dioxide, is brought to
the air (in the lungs); in the tadpole it is exposed, in the gills, to
the dissolved air of the surrounding water; while in the cockroach the
air is carried directly to the tissues needing fresh oxygen. The air
of the tubes is renewed by a rhythmic action of the abdomen, which can
readily be observed in the living insect.</p>

<p><b>The internal organs.</b>—Figs. <a href="#FIG_163"> 163</a>
and <a href="#FIG_223"> 223</a>, which represent a
general dissection of a frog and of a cockroach respectively, exhibit
in the most striking manner the essential differences in the structure
of vertebrates and arthropods. The fact that the skeleton of the frog
is wholly internal and that of the cockroach wholly external, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
already been mentioned. It will be seen, further, that while in the
frog the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) lies
entirely dorsal to the digestive canal, in the cockroach the great
nerve chain (<a href="#FIG_223">Fig. 223</a>, <i>n</i>, <i>n</i>,) is mainly ventral—the
only dorsal part of the central nervous system being the so called brain (<i>brn.</i>),
which is connected with the ventral chain by a ring surrounding the
gullet (<i>gul.</i>). The heart of the frog is ventral to the digestive
canal; that of the cockroach is the most dorsally placed organ of the body.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Habits and life-history.</b>—Cockroaches infest kitchens and
pantries; they are of social habits, and hide together in crevices
during the day, but come forth at night to feed. They are not at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
fastidious as to diet, but are especially fond of starchy foods, which
they are able to digest (<a href="#Page_234">p. 234</a>) by means of the fluid formed
in their large salivary glands (<a href="#FIG_223">Fig. 223</a>, <i>sal. gl.</i>).
The eggs are laid sixteen at a time in a little oblong case, which the female
carries about in a boat-shaped receptacle (<i>st.</i> 7, <a href="#FIG_223">Fig. 223</a>)
at the end of her abdomen, until she finds a suitable place in which to deposit it.
When the little cockroaches hatch, they are quite white, but except for
the absence of wings they closely resemble the parents in form, and
run about and feed freely from the first. The chitinous exoskeleton is
shed from time to time as the animal increases in size, a new coat, at
first soft and wrinkled, but rapidly stretching and hardening, having
previously formed beneath the old one. Shortly before the last moult,
the wing-covers and wings begin to grow out from the angles of the
second and third thoracic segments. In this manner the young animal
gradually takes on the form and dimensions of the adult.</p>

<p><b>The position of the cockroach in the insect class.</b>—The
cockroach is familiarly known as the “black-beetle,” but the name is a
very misleading one, because the true beetles differ from cockroaches
not only in structure, but also in life history. Cockroaches are
grouped with earwigs, grasshoppers, crickets, and locusts in the order
<b>Orthoptera</b>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
a term alluding to the fanlike folding of the hind-wings.</p>

<h4>63. A WATER BEETLE.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor"><small>[29]</small></a></h4>

<p>1. <b>The habits of Dytiscus.</b>—Search a pond for water beetles. Put
them in a wide-mouthed bottle with some of the weeds to be found in the
pond, and take them home and observe their habits. Among the larger
beetles—especially from ponds with a clear surface (not covered with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
duckweed, etc.)—will probably be seen some with a yellow band round
the edge of the upper surface. These are <i>Dytisci</i>. Notice the ovoid,
smooth body, the breadth of the hind legs, and—in the male—the cup on
each fore leg. Try to see how the legs of each pair are used. On what
does the animal feed? Take a small piece of meat in a pair of forceps
and hold it near the beetle’s head. If the animal does not notice it,
stroke one of the feelers with the meat; how does the beetle behave?
What is the use of the feelers? Notice how the beetle rises to the
surface immediately it stops paddling. Which end of the body sticks out
of the water? Why does the beetle need to come to the surface? In April look
for larvae (<a href="#FIG_224">Fig. 224</a><a href="#FIG_224"></a>, <i>A</i>),
and describe their appearance and habits.</p>

<p>2. <b>External characters.</b>—Kill a Dytiscus by dropping it
for a moment into boiling water. Examine it first from the dorsal
surface, noting the almost unbroken oval outline, and the firmness
of the armour. Notice that the inner edges of the two wing-covers
fit closely together in the middle line. How does the beetle compare
in this respect with the cockroach? Observe the small triangular
plate between the anterior ends of the wing-covers; open out the
covers and wings to find of which segment of the thorax it is a part.
Examine the wing-covers and wings closely; notice that the wings are
folded transversely as well as longitudinally. Spread and pin out one
wing-cover and wing of one side, and draw a dorsal view of the animal.
Dissect out the jaws and compare them with the jaws of the cockroach
(<a href="#FIG_222">Fig. 222</a>). Examine and draw one leg of each pair.</p>

<p><b>The bordered little diver.</b>—In nearly every English pond there
at times occurs a beetle—an inch or more in length—which is known to
naturalists as <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>. The name is somewhat cumbrous,
but it would be difficult to find a more appropriate one; for “bordered
little diver”—the plain English of the scientific term—indicates
at once the peculiarities which soonest strike the observer: the
creature’s skill in diving, and the yellow band which runs round the
edge of the olive-green body. The outline of the beetle is an almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
unbroken oval, and it is worth noticing that either such a boat-shape
(<a href="#FIG_224">Fig. 224</a>, <i>B</i>), or the cigar-shape of the torpedo
is adopted by almost all actively swimming aquatic animals. The resistance of
the water is further lessened by the smoothness of the beetle’s armour, which
forms a hard shell enclosing the body. As in all insects, the body is
divided into head, thorax, and abdomen. The eyes are large, and are so
arranged that the animal can at the same time see objects both above
and below—a great advantage to a creature living so active a life. The
feelers are very sensitive organs of touch, and possibly of smell also.
The jaws consist of one pair of mandibles and two pairs of maxillae,
and are shaped much like those of the cockroach; they are powerful,
and render Dytiscus a very formidable enemy to the more peaceable
inhabitants of the pond.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

            <i>A</i>, larva;&emsp;<i>B</i>, adult insect (male).</p>
</div>

<p>The thorax consists of the usual three segments, but only the first
and a small triangular area of the second are to be seen until the
wing-covers are pulled aside. These last differ from the wing-covers
of the cockroach not only in being much harder and stronger, but also
in their inner edges meeting accurately along the middle line of the
body. The delicate, filmy wings, which alone are of use in flight, are
folded transversely as well as longitudinally. On the lower side of the
thorax are three pairs of legs; they are very interesting and are worth
examining in some detail. In the male, the first leg on each side is
furnished with little circular areas which were at one time believed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
be suckers. It is now known, however, that they give off a sticky
substance which adheres firmly to any object clasped by the legs.
The middle pair of legs seems to be used chiefly for steering. In
both sexes the third or last pair of legs is modified to form a pair
of sculls. Ordinary land-beetles can move their legs in a vertical
direction, as well as in a horizontal one; but the hind legs of
water-beetles are jointed to the thorax in such a manner that they can
only move backwards and forwards, not up and down. The resemblance of
the hind leg to an oar does not stop here, however. On one side there
is a fringe of stiff hairs, forming the blade of the oar. The joint
carrying the hairs is so arranged that the beetle can “feather” its
oar—by turning the edge of the blade to the water—at each stroke.</p>

<p>Occasionally, usually after sunset, the beetle quits his watery
home, and “wheels his droning flight” in search of pastures new. His
flights are, however, only temporary and merely from one pond to
another. Although Dytiscus thus normally lives in water, very cursory
observation only is needed to see that he cannot exist without a
regular supply of fresh air. He no sooner stops paddling than his
body rises naturally to the surface, and as the tail is lighter than
the head, it rises out of the water. The wing-covers are now raised
a little, so that the space between them and the wings is put into
communication with the outside air. The impure gas contained in this
space is soon replaced by a bubble of fresh pure air, the wing-cases
are lowered, and the “little diver” plunges once more into the depths.
The water is prevented by hairs from getting into the air-space below
the wing-cases, and the true wings are thus kept always dry. The
spiracles (<a href="#Page_355">p. 355</a>) are in communication with the air-space,
so that the animal is enabled to remain below the surface for a relatively long time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The life-history of Dytiscus.</b>—In March or April the female
Dytiscus lays her eggs in slits which she cuts in the submerged stems
of pond-weeds, and the eggs hatch in about three weeks. The creature
which emerges from the egg is of active habits, but is not at all like
the parent in appearance. A young animal which leads an independent
and self-supporting life, and differs markedly in structure from the
adult, is called a <b>larva</b>. Thus a tadpole is a larval frog, and a
caterpillar is the larva of a butterfly or moth. The larva of Dytiscus
when of full size is about 2 inches in length. Like other larvae of its
family (<a href="#FIG_224">Fig. 224</a>, <i>A</i>), it has six slender legs, which
serve both for swimming and for crawling over the bottom of the pond, and its head
is provided with a pair of sickle-shaped mandibles, with which it seizes
its prey. Each mandible is grooved on its inner side, the groove being
converted into a tube by a membrane which covers it in. The savage
larva sucks the blood of its victim until literally nothing is left but
the shrivelled husk. At the end of the Dytiscus larva’s tail are two
appendages which are fringed with hair. When the creature wishes to
breathe it comes to the surface, and the tip of its tail protrudes out
of the water. As each of the appendages just mentioned is pierced with
a hole which leads into one of the two main air-tubes of the body, an
interchange of vitiated for pure air readily takes place.</p>

<p>When the larva is about six weeks old, it leaves the pond and buries
itself in the soil on the banks. Its exoskeleton is shed, and a thin,
transparent layer of chitin—the “pupa-skin”—takes its place. In this
condition the animal sinks into a state of torpor, and apparently
becomes as motionless as a mummy. In this resting stage it is called
a <b>pupa</b>. The pupal stage is necessary for the completion of the
great changes—commenced some time previously—which must take place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
before the larva can acquire the structure of the adult. The pupal
stage lasts two or three weeks, and when at last the creature emerges
from its cell it is a beetle like its parents.</p>

<p>In consisting of three well-marked stages, the life-history of a beetle
thus differs essentially from that of a cockroach. All beetles agree
with Dytiscus in this respect, though in manner of life almost every
conceivable variation is found. The beetle-order of insects receives
its scientific name—<b>Coleoptera</b><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>—from
the sheathing character of the strong and closely-fitting wing-covers.
The wings themselves are large, and folded in a somewhat complex
manner. The mouth parts greatly resemble those of the cockroach.</p>

<h4>64. BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor"><small>[31]</small></a></h4>

<p>1. <b>Cabbage-white butterflies.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>The eggs.</i>—In May or
September, search the leaves of cabbages, turnips, and other crucifers
(<a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a>) for the tiny eggs of cabbage-white butterflies.
Do the eggs occur singly or in clusters? Are they found on the upper or the lower
surface of the leaf? Cut off a piece of leaf which carries eggs,
put it under a tumbler, and examine it every day until the larvae
(caterpillars) emerge from the eggs.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The larva.</i>—Have ready a “breeding-cage,” <i>i.e.</i> a box
measuring, say, 18” × 8” × 6”, one large face of which is of perforated
zinc or fine wire gauze, and the other of glass; the box should be
without bottom, so that it can be placed over a food-plant. Put the
larvae, with leaves of the plant on which they were found, under the
box, and observe them carefully. Replace all rotted or soiled leaves by
fresh ones. It is best to keep the food-plant in a bottle of wet sand
inside the case; the leaves then remain fresh for several days.</p>

<p>Describe the appearance of the caterpillar; notice its general
worm-like form and absence of wings. In the <i>head</i>, observe the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
small feelers, and watch the action of the mandibles in feeding. Behind
the head come the three segments of the <i>thorax</i>; notice that each
bears a pair of short, jointed legs. How many segments can you see
in the <i>abdomen</i>? Which of the abdominal segments bear legs or feet?
How do these differ from the thoracic legs? Look for the spiracles
(<a href="#Page_355">p. 355</a>) at the sides of the body. Which segments have
spiracles? Kill a full-fed caterpillar by immersing it in methylated spirit, or
by putting it into a small box with a few drops of ether (<i>a most
inflammable liquid</i>) or chloroform. When it is dead, examine it more
closely. Try to make out the mouth-parts clearly; they are best seen
from the back of the head. The labium (<a href="#Page_353">p. 353</a>) is here
represented by a conical body called the <i>spinneret</i>, out of which come
the silken threads used to protect the pupa.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The pupa.</i>—When the larva is full-fed, it seeks out a sheltered
place, and fixes itself in position by means of silk threads which
issue from the spinneret; the larval skin is shed and replaced by a
pupal skin, and the animal remains quiescent until the change from
larva to butterfly is complete. Examine the manner of attachment of the
pupa to its support. Kill a pupa by immersion in methylated spirit,
or by dipping it for a moment in boiling water; carefully strip off
the skin, and make a drawing of the animal. Especially notice the
arrangement of the wings and legs.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The imago or winged insect.</i>—When the internal organs of the
butterfly are completed, the pupal skin splits, and the perfect insect
comes out. Look for pupae between September and March, or in July,
and try to see the transformation. Notice the method of flight of
the butterfly, and the position in which the wings are held when it
settles. At what time of the day, and in what kind of weather, have
you seen cabbage-whites flying? Kill a butterfly by putting it into a
bottle containing crushed laurel leaves, or a few lumps of potassium
cyanide (<i>a deadly poison</i>) wrapped in blotting paper, and examine it closely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(i) <i>The head.</i>—Notice the large, compound eyes, the knobbed
feelers, the long and coiled <i>proboscis</i>, and the labial palps (which
look like tusks).</p>

<p>(ii) The thorax.—The true form of the thorax and abdomen is
concealed by the hairs which clothe the body. Wet the body with
methylated spirit to make the hairs lie down. Notice that the first and
third segments of the thorax are very small, while the middle segment,
which carries the fore-wings, is large. Observe that the fore-wings are
not modified into wing-covers, but are, generally speaking, much like
the hind-wings. Determine the sex of the specimen by means of <a href="#FIG_225">Fig. 225</a>.
Notice that, when you touch a wing, a little white dust comes off on
your finger; the dust consists of very small scales. Do both surfaces
of the wings bear scales? With a rather stiff camel-hair brush, brush
the scales from the wings of one side. What markings have been removed,
and what new markings have been made clear, by the removal of the
scales? How many legs has the butterfly?</p>

<p>(iii) <i>The abdomen.</i>—Count the segments.</p>
</div>

<p>2. <b>The tiger moth.</b>—In early summer examine lettuce, strawberry,
and nettle leaves for “woolly bears”—the hairy caterpillars of the
tiger moth. Keep these in the breeding-cage with the food-plants, and
observe and describe their appearance and habits. How do they behave
when alarmed? Watch them spin their cocoons (pupa cases) about the end
of June, and describe the process. Examine the pupa, and state in what
respects it differs from the caterpillar. About the end of July watch
for the emergence of the perfect moth.</p>

<p>Notice the position of the wings of a resting moth. Are they held like
those of a butterfly? Kill and examine the moth, and compare it further
with a butterfly. Especially notice</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) That the feelers of the tiger moth are not knobbed at the ends,
but are either thread-like (in the female) or comb-like (in the male); and</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That a bristle at the base of the hind-wing hooks on a catch
in the fore-wing of the same side. </p>
</div>

<p>3. <b>The vapourer moth.</b>—About the end of June examine rose trees,
fruit trees, willows, oaks, etc., for caterpillars of the vapourer
moth. They may be recognised (<a href="#FIG_228">Fig. 228</a>) by the reddish warts
and the tufts of hair which stand out from various parts of the body. Notice
that the caterpillars fall into two groups according to size, being,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
when full-grown, about 2 in. and 1¼ in. long respectively. Keep
the larvae in a breeding-cage until they pupate and change into
moths; notice that the moths (the females) which come from the large
caterpillars have no wings; while the male moths, which are derived
from the small caterpillars, have well-developed wings.</p>

<p><b>A typical butterfly.</b>—The great beauty of butterflies and moths,
and the ease with which the stages of their wonderful life-history can
be followed, have made these insects favourite objects of study among
naturalists of all ages.</p>

<p>Among the commonest of butterflies are the well-known
<b>cabbage-whites</b>, the caterpillars of which work so much havoc
upon crops of cruciferous plants (<a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a>). The eggs are
laid in May and September upon the leaves, and soon hatch out into small larvae
called caterpillars, which feed voraciously and grow rapidly. The
larval skin is shed from time to time as it becomes too small. The
<b>caterpillar</b> (<a href="#FIG_225">Fig. 225</a>, <i>A</i>) is somewhat worm-like
in appearance, but insect characters may easily be recognised in it. The <i>head</i>
is small and shiny. It carries six eye-spots, but the large compound
eyes of the adult are not yet visible. A pair of short feelers is
present; and the mouth-parts are obviously comparable with those of the
cockroach, although the labium (<a href="#Page_353">p. 353</a>) has become converted
into a <i>spinneret</i>, which gives out the silk threads used for the protection
of the pupa. The mandibles, which are used in gnawing leaves, are stout
and toothed; the first maxillae are rather small. Behind the head come
the three segments of the <i>thorax</i>, each of which bears a pair of
short jointed legs; wings have not, as yet, developed. The <i>abdomen</i>
really consists of ten segments, although only nine can be seen without
dissection. Segments 3 to 6 of the abdomen bear short, unjointed legs
called <i>pro-legs</i> or <i>cushion feet</i>, and the last segment bears a pair
of appendages called the <i>anal feet</i>. Spiracles are to be seen on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
first eight abdominal segments. In the larva of the green-veined
cabbage-white, each spiracle is reddish and surrounded by a yellow border.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        <i>B</i>, pupa; <i>C</i>, perfect insect.<br />
       (All ×&nbsp;⅔.) (<i>B</i> and <i>C</i> from photographs by Mr. A. Flatters)</p>
</div>

<p>When the caterpillar has attained its full size, it stops feeding
and seeks out a sheltered place—often a chink in a wall. Silken
threads are given off by the spinnerets until a little heap of silk
is formed into which the hooked end of the abdomen is fixed. Then a
girdle of silk is made, passed round the thicker fore-part of the
body, and so attached to the wall that the animal is supported in an
upright position. The larval skin now splits and is peeled off, and
the <b>pupa</b>, or chrysalis, stage (<a href="#FIG_225">Fig. 225</a>, <i>B</i>)
is entered upon. All the external parts of the butterfly are complete at the time
of pupation, but profound changes are still necessary in the internal
organs; it is to allow these changes to take place in tranquillity that
the resting, or pupal, stage is interposed between larval and adult life.</p>

<p>At last the new organs are ready for their work, the pupal skin cracks,
and the <b>perfect insect</b> (<a href="#FIG_225">Fig. 225</a>, <i>C</i>) emerges. The head now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
carries a pair of large compound eyes, and two slender feelers with
knobbed ends. The jaws also have been remodelled in accordance with
the completely different manner of life upon which the insect is now
entering. The mandibles are now only doubtfully recognisable; the first
pair of maxillae are elongated and grooved, and are closely applied
to each other to form a long tube called the <i>proboscis</i> (<a href="#FIG_226">Fig. 226</a>,
<i>Mx.</i> 1), which, when not in use for sucking up the sweet juices of
flowers, is kept coiled up beneath the head; the palps of the labium
(<i>Lab. Pa.</i>) project like tusks on the sides of the head. The thorax
is provided with two pairs of broad wings, which are covered with
minute overlapping scales—forming a delicate “bloom” which is readily
detached by rough handling. In many butterflies and moths the scales
are gorgeously coloured and arranged in symmetrical patterns. The name
<b>Lepidoptera</b>,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
which is applied to this order of insects, was suggested by the scaly
covering of the wings. When the butterfly is at rest the wings are
either fully expanded horizontally, or are held vertically over the
back, the upper surfaces of the fore wings being in contact. The first
segment of the thorax, which bears the first of the three pairs of
legs, is greatly reduced; the third segment also is but small.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>In short, the whole organisation of a butterfly is definitely adapted
to the special duties which belong to this period of its life. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
growing stage is over; the sole object of life is now to seek a mate
and—in the case of the female—to lay the eggs in a place where
the future larvae may find plenty of food. Ease of locomotion and
conspicuousness are secured by the broad and brilliantly-coloured
wings; the peculiar manner of flight is considerable protection against
the attacks of birds; large eyes aid in the recognition of the mate;
and a concentrated and easily-digested food is supplied by the nectar
of flowers, and made accessible by the long, sucking proboscis—the
service of cross-pollination (<a href="#Page_92">p. 92</a>) often being
unconsciously rendered in return for the sweet draught.</p>

<p>The common species of cabbage-white butterflies spend the winter as
pupae; the perfect insects emerge in April, lay their eggs, and then
die. The caterpillars pupate and a second generation of butterflies
appears, their offspring reaching the pupa stage about the end of autumn.</p>

<p><b>Moths.</b>—Moths pass through a life-history which is identical,
in its broad features, with that of butterflies. The larva which
hatches from the egg is a caterpillar, whose life is spent in feeding
and growing. At the same time the external features of the adult are
gradually taking form under the skin. When at last the full larval size
is attained, and a resting stage is necessary for the perfection of the
internal organs, the caterpillar’s skin splits, and is shed, and the
animal becomes a pupa or chrysalis. A moth-pupa is generally somewhat
egg-shaped (<a href="#FIG_227">Fig. 227</a>), whereas the pupa of a
butterfly is usually conical, though there are many exceptions.</p>

<p>The winged moth, which at length emerges from the pupal skin, differs
from a butterfly in certain obvious respects. Its body is usually broad
and thick; its feelers are either comb-like or thread like, not knobbed
at the ends; the two wings of one side are in most cases secured
together at the base by one or more bristles on the hind-wing hooking
over a catch on the fore-wing; in rest, the wings usually slope and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
not fully extended. Whereas butterflies usually fly only in the
sunshine, moths often fly by night, and the flowers which night-flying
moths frequent for nectar are as a rule white and strongly-scented,
and close during the day. In finding their mates, moths seem to depend
largely upon the sense of smell, which is probably lodged in the feelers.</p>

<p>The life-history of a typical moth is well exemplified by the
<b>Tiger Moth</b> (<a href="#FIG_227">Fig. 227</a>), which is easily reared
in captivity. The larva—often called the “woolly bear,” from its thick covering
of hair—may be found in early summer on the leaves of lettuce,
strawberry, nettle, and other plants. It pupates about the end of June,
working its hair, together with silk spun by the spinneret, into a
<i>cocoon</i>, in which the resting stage is passed. About a month later
the perfect moth emerges; its fore-wings are beautifully mottled with
cream colour and chocolate brown; the hind-wings are red, with metallic
violet spots. The feelers of the male are comb-like, and are probably
very sensitive organs of smell, by means of which he seeks out his
mate. The female’s feelers are thread-like.</p>

<p>In the <b>Vapourer Moth</b> (<a href="#FIG_228">Fig. 228</a>), whose “looping”
flight may often be observed even in the streets of towns during the day, the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
sexes are remarkably different from each other. The male (<i>C</i>) alone
can fly; the female (<i>D</i>) is wingless, and is confined for the whole of
her short adult life to the place where she emerged from the cocoon.
Here she lays her eggs and then dies. Neither she nor her mate is
capable of feeding.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a more striking example of the fact that
the one duty of the adult moth is reproduction. The female vapourer
is even debarred from the privilege of choosing favourable places for
her eggs; but a compensation for this disadvantage lies in the agility
of the larvae (<i>A</i>), which are able to migrate without difficulty to
another plant whenever food becomes scarce. As Prof. Miall remarks:<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
“Whatever the larva can do for itself, the female can safely leave
undone; but what the larva cannot do, by reason of sluggishness or
restricted diet, the parent must provide for. Hence activity and
intelligence in the one lead to degeneration in the other.... Wings are
to insects what spores are to ferns, plumed seeds to dandelions, and
hooked seeds to burrs—a ready means of dispersal.”</p>

<p><b>Other insects.</b>—Space does not permit of more than a reference
to other insects, and the work of this chapter is to be regarded as the
merest introduction to the study of this fascinating class of animals.
The chief remaining orders are the <b>Neuroptera</b>, including May
flies, dragon flies, and caddis flies; the <b>Hemiptera</b>, among
which are included the various “bugs,” water boatmen, plant lice, etc.;
the <b>Diptera</b> (two-winged flies), such as the house-fly, gnat,
harlequin fly, daddy-long-legs, etc.; and the <b>Hymenoptera</b>,
including bees, wasps, ants, gall flies (<a href="#Page_146">p. 146</a>), and ichneumons. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
of these insects have aquatic larvae which may be found in ponds; and
their life-histories should be studied in aquaria and careful notes
made of the transformations.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">SOME CRUSTACEANS, MOLLUSCS,<br /> AND WORMS.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4>65. SOME COMMON CRUSTACEANS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>The crayfish and lobster.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Habits.</i>—Readers in
limestone districts will probably be able to find crayfishes in the
streams, and the habits of the animals in their natural surroundings
should be observed and described. Other readers will be able to obtain
live specimens from dealers.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Place the animal on the table or desk. Notice that the body consists of
an anterior, unsegmented portion, the <i>cephalothorax</i> (corresponding
to the head <i>plus</i> the thorax of an insect), and a posterior, jointed
<i>abdomen</i>. Watch the movements of the stalked eyes, the feelers and
legs; allow the claws of the largest pair of legs (the “pincers”) to
grasp a pencil. Put the crayfish in a white dish, with an inch or two
of water, and by means of a pipette discharge a few drops of water
containing some suspended colouring matter, such as carmine or indigo,
near the point of attachment of the last walking leg. Describe the
movements of the coloured water. When the animal is startled, notice
the sudden vertical flexure of the abdomen, by means of which the body
is pulled backward in the water. Feed the crayfish with meat or worms,
and try to see the action of the jaws.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>External characters.</i>—Kill the crayfish instantaneously by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
dropping it into boiling water. Compare the animal with a cockroach (p.
349). Examine more closely the stalked eyes, the two pairs of feelers,
the <i>four</i> pairs of walking legs and the single pair of large pincers,
and the fusion of the head and thorax to form the cephalothorax. Count
the segments of the abdomen.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The appendages.</i>—Examine the ventral surface of the abdomen,
and notice that each segment, except the last, bears a pair of small
jointed organs; these are called <i>swimmerets</i>. Remove one of the pair
carried by the last segment but two, examine and draw it; make out that
it consists of a stalk and two branches. Notice that the branches of
the swimmerets of the last segment but one are expanded, and form, with
the last segment, the <i>tail fin</i>.</p>

<p>Study the appendages of the cephalothorax from behind forwards. They
consist of (i) four pairs of legs used for walking, and a larger pair
of pincers; (ii) three pairs of foot-jaws or <i>maxillipedes</i>; (iii) two
pairs of <i>maxillae</i>; (iv) one pair of <i>mandibles</i>; (v) two pairs of
<i>feelers</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The gills.</i>—With strong scissors cut off the side part of the
exoskeleton of the cephalothorax, and notice the plume-like <i>gills</i> in
the <i>gill-chamber</i> thus laid open. Move the adjoining legs, and see
that some of the gills also move.</p>

<p>2. <b>The crab.</b>—Obtain a crab and compare it, point by point,
with the crayfish, or lobster. Notice the great width of the shell of
the cephalothorax; much of this width is due to the gill-covers, which
stand out from the sides of the true body. Look for the opening of the
gill-chamber at the base of the pincers. Make out the stalked eyes (in
sockets), the two pairs of feelers, and the five pairs of legs. Notice
how the animal runs; in what respects does the method differ from the
gait of the crayfish? Examine the ventral surface of a dead specimen,
and notice that the abdomen is tucked under the cephalothorax. Stretch
out the abdomen; compare it with that of the crayfish, and count the
segments. Notice the absence of the tail fin; it is not required,
as the crab does not swim. Extend the abdomen, and make drawings of
the animal (i) from above, and (ii) from below, and label the parts.
Carefully remove the foot-jaws and the true jaws, and compare them with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
the corresponding appendages of the crayfish. With strong scissors cut
off one of the gill-covers, and examine the gills. Observe that in the
crab the gills are not in any case attached to appendages; they all
spring from the sides of the body-wall.</p>

<p>Tabulate the respects in which you have found the crayfish and crab (i)
to agree with, (ii) to differ from, insects.</p>

</div>

<p>The student who has worked through <a href="#Page_349">Chapter XIX.</a> will at
once recognise in a crayfish, or a lobster, an animal possessing many features in
common with the insects, and will find it interesting to try to
discover for himself why it is not called an insect, but is placed by
naturalists in a different class.</p>

<p><b>The crayfish.</b>—The crayfish (<a href="#FIG_229">Fig. 229</a>), or the
lobster (which agrees closely in structure with the crayfish), is obviously an
<b>arthropod</b> (<a href="#Page_351">p. 351</a>), for it is covered by an exoskeleton
of chitin, and has hollow jointed limbs and a segmented body. In these
respects it agrees with the insects. On the other hand, it plainly
possesses at least five pairs of legs, and has two pairs of feelers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
(<i>ant.</i> 1 and <i>ant.</i> 2, <a href="#FIG_229">Fig. 229</a>), whereas no insect
has more than three pairs of legs (when adult), or more than one pair of feelers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_230" id="FIG_230"></a>
    <img src="images/i_375.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="235" />

     <span class="smcap">Fig. 230.</span>—Crayfish; the right gill-chamber and
     gills as seen after removal of the right gill-cover. <i>a₁</i>, <i>a₂</i>,
     feelers; 6-13, sixth to thirteenth appendages; xiv, xv, first and
     second abdominal segments; <i>E</i>, eye; <i>ep.</i> 5, scoop on second maxilla;

     <i>pdb.</i> 12, gill attached to twelfth appendage; <i>plb.</i> 13, gill on
     body-wall above thirteenth appendage. (Slightly reduced.)</p>
</div>

<p>These differences are apparent at the first glance, and closer
examination reveals even greater contrasts. The three primary divisions
of the body into head, thorax, and abdomen, which are so characteristic
of insects, are not obvious in the crayfish; for the head and thorax
are here fused into one mass, the <b>cephalothorax</b><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
(<a href="#FIG_229">Fig. 229</a>, <i>c.th.</i>), which is covered by a shield called the <b>carapace</b>.
Moreover, in the crayfish <i>every</i> segment except the last bears a
pair of <b>appendages</b>, which vary in form in different regions of
the body according to their duties, but which can all be shown, by
careful comparison, to be modifications of one primitive form, which
is <b>Y</b>-shaped and consists of a basal stalk and two branches.
This form of appendage is well seen in the <i>swimmerets</i> (17, <a href="#FIG_229">Fig. 229</a>)
of the abdominal region; further forwards the appendages become
<i>walking legs</i> (9-13, <a href="#FIG_229">Fig. 229</a>); next come three pairs which combine
the characters of legs and jaws, and are called <i>maxillipedes</i> (8, <a href="#FIG_229">Fig. 229</a>);
then are the true jaws—two pairs of <i>maxillae</i>, and one pair of
biting and crushing <i>mandibles</i>; and lastly, in front of the jaws, two
pairs of <i>feelers</i> (<i>ant.</i> 2 and <i>ant.</i> 1). It is believed that
the first pair of feelers corresponds to the single pair of feelers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
cockroach; that the jaws correspond to the jaws; that the maxillipedes
of the crayfish are the equivalents of the walking legs of the
cockroach; while the remaining appendages of the crayfish have no
representatives in the insect.</p>

<p>Lastly, the crayfish differs essentially from the insect in its method
of <b>respiration</b> (<a href="#Page_355">p. 355</a>), for it is an aquatic animal
and breathes <i>dissolved</i> oxygen. It therefore possesses neither lungs nor
spiracles but <b>gills</b> (<a href="#FIG_230">Fig. 230</a>). These are situated
at the sides of the true body-wall, in gill-chambers formed by the downgrowth of
the sides of the carapace. The gills are delicate plumes, containing fine
blood-vessels, so that an exchange of gases readily takes place between
the blood and the surrounding water. On each side, a scoop (<a href="#FIG_230">Fig. 230</a>,
<i>ep.</i> 5) on the second maxilla is continually baling water out of the
front of the gill-chamber, fresh water flowing in from behind to take
its place. Certain of the gills are attached to the legs, so that the
motion of the legs also is some assistance to respiration.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><b>The crab</b> (<a href="#FIG_231">Fig. 231</a>) is markedly different in
shape from the crayfish or lobster, but is nevertheless easily seen to be built
on essentially the same lines of structure. It also consists of
twenty segments, of which the first thirteen are fused to form a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
cephalothorax; and the appendages of this region are quite comparable
with those of the crayfish. The great width of the shell is largely
due to the gill-covers, which stand out from the sides of the body
much further than do those of the crayfish. As a result the crab finds
it easy to run side-first. The crab is essentially a walking, not a
swimming, animal, and the abdomen—upon which the crayfish and lobster
so much depend in swimming—is in the crab reduced in size and kept
tucked under the cephalothorax.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 232.</span>—The<br />Wood-louse.<br />(×&nbsp;1.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Crustaceans.</b>—These facts are sufficient to show that the
title “insect” cannot with any propriety be given to either the
crayfish or the crab, unless, indeed, the term is to be applied to all
arthropods indiscriminately. The crayfish, lobsters, shrimps, prawns,
crabs, barnacles, and many less-familiar animals, are placed in the
<b>crustacean</b> class of arthropods. Crustaceans have usually a
distinct head, thorax, and abdomen; but some of the thoracic segments
may be fused with the head to form a cephalothorax (<a href="#Page_375">p. 375</a>).
Like other arthropods, the animals are covered with an armour of chitin, and in
many cases this is so hardened, except at the joints, by mineral matter
that it becomes a rigid shell or crust. The head bears two pairs of
feelers in addition to the jaws; and the segments of the thorax and
abdomen are provided with appendages which are variously modified as
jaw-feet, legs, swimmerets, etc. Typically, the animals breathe by
gills and are aquatic, but forms are known which are able to live
comfortably on land if the gills are kept moist. One of the most
interesting examples of this is found in the common <b>wood-louse</b>
(<a href="#FIG_232">Fig. 232</a>), which lurks under stones and logs in damp
and dark situations, and breathes by plate-like gills on the abdominal segments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Other arthropods.</b>—Other familiar arthropods, which are neither
insects nor crustaceans, are spiders and centipedes. The spiders belong
to the <b>arachnid class</b>, and the centipedes to the <b>myriapod
class</b> of arthropods.</p>

<h4>66. SOME COMMON MOLLUSCS.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor"><small>[37]</small></a></h4>

<p>1. <b>The fresh-water mussel.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Habits.</i>—Study the habits
of the living animal (<a href="#FIG_233">Fig. 233</a>) in the aquarium. Notice the muscular
<i>foot</i> which is protruded between the halves (<i>valves</i>) of the shell,
and by means of which the mussel slowly makes its way along the sandy
bottom. With a pipette, discharge some water, coloured with carmine
or indigo, close to the more pointed end of the shell. Where is the
coloured water taken in, and where is it expelled? Notice that the
shell closes when the animal is handled.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The regions of the shell.</i>—The rounded end is anterior, the
more pointed end posterior, the straight hinge-line dorsal, and the
gape ventral. Notice the knob-like <i>umbo</i> on each side near the
anterior end of the hinge; it is the oldest part of the valve. Make out
the concentric lines of growth, showing the successive positions of the
margin. Draw the shell from the right side and from above.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>General structure.</i>—Kill the mussel by putting it for a few
minutes into hot, but not boiling, water. Notice that the valves of
the shell now gape apart somewhat. Hold up the animal and see, lining
the shell, a thin soft membrane, the <i>mantle</i>. Carefully separate
the mantle from one valve and notice, near each end, a thick white
pillar which passes from one valve to the other. These pillars are the
<i>closing muscles</i>. Pass the blade of a knife between the mantle and
valve, and cut through each closing muscle quite near to the valve.
Turn the valve back and remove it from the other valve by cutting
through the elastic <i>ligament</i> (at the hinge) with strong scissors.
Clean the inside of the separated valve and examine it; notice (i) the
line of attachment of the mantle; (ii) the impressions of the closing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
muscles; (iii) the lines of shifting of the closing muscles—triangular
depressions stretching from the umbo to the muscles.</p>

<p>Examine the animal as it lies in the other valve. Make out: (i) The
right and left lobes of the <i>mantle</i> which line the valves and (in the
natural position of the mussel) hang down from the sides of the body;
(ii) the two plate-like <i>gills</i> on each side, lying between the mantle
and the foot; (iii) the median <i>foot</i>; (iv) the reddish, triangular
<i>palps</i> surrounding the <i>mouth</i>—an aperture at the anterior end of
the foot. Push a stout pin into the mouth and upwards into the gullet. Make
a drawing showing the relative positions of the parts.</p>

<p>2. <b>The garden snail.</b>—(<i>a</i>) <i>Habits.</i>—Where have you
seen snails? At what time of the year are they most active? Upon what do
they feed? Place a snail upon a lettuce leaf and carefully watch its
method of eating. How does it move about? Put a live snail upon a sheet
of glass, and look through the glass to see the wave-like action of the
flat sole—the <i>foot</i>—by means of which it moves.</p>

<p>Have you ever found snails in winter? How much of the animal was
visible? How is the mouth of the shell closed in winter?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>General appearance.</i>—Make a drawing of the animal from the
left side and another from the right side, and notice the differences
between the two. Is the shell placed over the middle of the animal, or
does it lie to one side? How many turns has the spiral of the shell? In
a fully expanded snail observe the fleshy “collar” round the margin of
the shell; it is the edge of the <i>mantle</i>. Notice the rounded <i>head</i>,
the two pairs of <i>tentacles</i>, the <i>eye-spot</i> at the tip of each of the
larger and upper tentacles, the <i>mouth</i>, and, near the base of the
shell on the right side, the <i>respiratory pore</i>, which opens into the
<i>lung</i>. Touch various parts of the body in turn to see if they are
irritable; how are the tentacles retracted? Can the animal close and
open its respiratory pore at will?</p>

<p>3. <b>An air-breathing pond-snail.</b>—Obtain several fresh-water
snails and study their habits in glass aquaria. The commonest
fresh-water snails are species of <i>Limnaea</i>; identify some of these by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
comparison with <a href="#FIG_234">Fig. 234</a>, <i>A</i>, and try to make out
the parts already seen in the garden snail. Watch the action of the mouth as the
animal feeds on the green scum which often collects on the sides of aquaria.
Notice how it creeps over the glass or along the surface-film of the
water. When the snail comes to the surface it replaces the air of its
lung by fresh air, and a bubble may often be seen escaping from the
respiratory opening under the lip of the shell. Look for the spawn
(<i>egg-masses</i>) of this snail on leaves or on the sides of the aquarium,
and examine the eggs frequently with a hand lens.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Molluscs.</b>—Molluscs are soft-bodied animals, in most cases
protected by a hard, external shell, but they differ essentially from
crustaceans and all other arthropods in not being segmented, and in
not possessing jointed limbs. Familiar and instructive examples of two
classes of the group are found in the fresh-water mussel and the garden snail.</p>

<p>The <b>fresh-water mussel</b> (<a href="#FIG_233">Fig. 233</a>) is to be found
in streams, along the bed of which it ploughs its way by means of a muscular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
<b>foot</b> (<i>ft.</i>). The body is enclosed in a brown shell, which
consists of halves called <b>valves</b>, hinged together along the
straight, dorsal edge by an elastic <b>ligament</b> (<i>lg.</i>). The action
of the ligament is to separate the valves slightly unless they are
forcibly held together by the contraction of closing muscles which
run from one valve to the other. Hence the shell of a dead mussel
always gapes open. The rounded end of the shell is anterior, the more
pointed end posterior. The oldest part of each valve is the <b>umbo</b>
(<i>um.</i>, <a href="#FIG_233">Fig. 233</a>), a knob just in front of the ligament;
and concentric lines surrounding the umbo mark successive positions of the margin of
the valve as the animal increased in size. The valves are formed by
the activity of the <b>mantle lobes</b> (<i>m.</i>)—a pair of delicate
membranes which hang down from the sides of the body. The foot is a
median prolongation of the body itself, and on each side a pair of
plate-like <b>gills</b> lies between the foot and the mantle lobe of
that side. “Thus the whole animal has been compared to a book, the
back being represented by the hinge, the covers by the valves, the
fly-leaves by the mantle lobes, the first two and the last two pages by
the gills, and the remainder of the leaves by the foot.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>When the living mussel is undisturbed, the mantle folds project
slightly at the hinder end of the shell, their edges being so placed
in contact that they form two short tubes. A current of water flows in
at the lower of these (<i>in. sph.</i>, <a href="#FIG_233">Fig. 233</a>), carrying
to the mouth a supply of food-particles, and to the gills and mantle a store of
dissolved oxygen; while an outgoing current leaves by the upper tube
(<i>ex. sph.</i>).</p>

<p>The <b>garden snail</b> (<a href="#FIG_234">Fig. 234</a>, <i>B</i>) seems
at first sight to have but little resemblance to a mussel; but it also is a
mollusc—consisting of a soft, unsegmented body, which is produced
ventrally into a <b>foot</b>, and is protected by a <b>shell</b> formed
by the activity of a <b>mantle fold</b> of the body. In this case,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
however, the shell is one piece, and is spirally coiled. The snail has
also a distinct <b>head</b>, which bears two pairs of tentacles; at the
tip of each of the longer and upper tentacles (<i>t</i>) is an eye (<i>e</i>).
The animal crawls about by wave-like contractions of the muscular foot;
it feeds upon vegetation, which it rasps into small particles by means
of a toothed tongue, and then swallows. The snail is entirely adapted
to a terrestrial life, and breathes air—the mantle fold under the
shell enclosing a <b>lung chamber</b> with blood-vessels in its walls,
which opens to the exterior by a respiratory pore (<i>p.o.</i>, <a href="#FIG_234">Fig. 234</a>)
on the right side. The snail spends the winter, in a state of torpor,
under logs or stones, the body being entirely retracted into the shell,
the mouth of which is closed by a plate of hardened slime.</p>

<p><b>Slugs</b> (<a href="#FIG_235">Fig. 235</a>) are of very similar structure,
but in them the shell has almost disappeared, even the trace which remains being
concealed by the mantle fold.</p>

<p>Among the commonest of fresh-water snails are various species of
<b>Limnaea</b> (<a href="#FIG_234">Fig. 234</a>, <i>A</i>). They may be found abundantly in ponds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
and are often kept in aquaria, where they perform a useful service
by devouring the minute plants which are apt to accumulate to an
undesirable extent and form green scum on the sides. These snails,
like the garden snail, breathe air, and often come to the surface to
take a fresh supply into their lung chambers. Some other water snails,
however, breathe <i>dissolved</i> oxygen by means of gills beneath the shell.</p>

<h4>67. EARTHWORMS.</h4>

<p>1. <b>External characters.</b>—Dig up several earthworms from the
soil and examine them. What is the <i>length</i> of the largest and of the
smallest specimens? What is the <i>thickness</i> of the body? Watch the
worms crawling about, and describe the method of locomotion. Has the
animal any legs? Do the length and thickness of any one worm vary
during its movements? Is the variation connected with locomotion? How?
Can you distinguish between the fore (anterior) and hind (posterior)
ends, and between the upper (dorsal) and lower (ventral) surfaces? How
do they differ?</p>

<p>Kill a large worm by immersion in methylated spirit and examine it more
closely. Notice the segmented character of the body, and estimate the
number of segments. Which part of the body has the largest segments?
Observe the swollen appearance of segments 32 to 37; this region is
called the <i>clitellum</i>. Notice the <i>mouth</i> (overhung by a short lobe)
in the first segment, and the <i>vent</i> in the last segment. On the
ventral surface of segment 14 try to see a pair of small pores; these
pores are the openings through which the <i>eggs</i> are discharged from the
body. Pull the worm gently between your fingers, and notice the bristly
feel; in which direction of motion is this most apparent? Examine the
ventral surface with a strong lens in a good light, and try to see four
double rows of very small <i>bristles</i>.</p>

<p>2. <b>Habits.</b>—Examine the surface of the ground of a garden or
lawn at night by help of a lantern or lamp, being careful to tread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
lightly, and observe the actions of any worms you see. Are more worms
to be seen at night than during the day? Do the worms seem disturbed by
the light of the lantern? Try to grasp one; is it easily caught? Why
not? Where does the worm retreat? If you can grasp a worm before it has
time to withdraw completely into its burrow, observe the difficulty of
drawing it out without tearing it. Try if the worms are disturbed by a
loud shout (be careful not to blow upon them when shouting), or by a
heavy stamp of your foot.</p>

<p>Carefully lay open several <i>burrows</i> and notice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Whether the mouths of the burrows are plugged in any way,
and, if leaves are used for this purpose, whether the leaves have been
dragged into the hole (i) by the broad ends, (ii) by the narrow ends,
or (iii) by the sides; do you find any signs of intelligence in the
method adopted?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The length and width of the burrow and the character of
its lining.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The end of the burrow; is it enlarged?</p>
</div>

<p>Examine <i>worm castings</i>. Mark out a square yard of surface and collect,
dry, and weigh all the castings found on this area in a certain time,
say a month. Such observations should be made at different periods
of the year, and over different kinds of soil, and comparisons made.
Estimate the weight brought up per acre by worms during a year. Are the
particles composing the castings very fine, fine, or coarse?</p>

<p>Place worms in glass-covered flower-pots with earth of different
degrees of firmness, and observe the methods of burrowing in loose and
in firmly compacted earth respectively. Place pieces of leaf of carrot,
onion, and cabbage on the surface, and at night observe how the worms
grasp the pieces and drag them into the burrows.</p>

<p><b>Earthworms.</b>—Few people except naturalists have any idea of the
vast number of earthworms living in the surface soil of this and most
other countries, or of the importance of the work which they do.</p>

<p>The common earthworm (<a href="#FIG_236">Fig. 236</a>) is much simpler in
structure than any of the animals previously considered in this book. It is roughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
cylindrical in shape, though somewhat flattened on the ventral surface.
It is divided into about 150 segments, which are marked on the exterior
by grooves running round the body. The mouth is an opening in the first
segment (<a href="#FIG_236">Fig. 236</a>, 1) and is overhung by a short fleshy lobe.
The worm crawls along by alternate elongation and shortening of its body, being
aided by short bristles which are directed backwards and act as pivots;
limbs are entirely absent. The animal is very sensitive to touch,
even to the vibrations of the ground; but it is stone-deaf, only just
capable of distinguishing between light and darkness, and has very
little sense of smell.</p>

<div class="figright">
    <a name="FIG_236" id="FIG_236"></a>
    <img src="images/i_385.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="239" />

          1, 15, 33, first, fifteenth,<br /> and thirty-third segments.<br /> (×&nbsp;½.)</p>
</div>

<p>During the day, the earthworm generally remains in its burrow in the
soil, with its head just inside the entrance. Its method of forming the
burrow depends upon the texture of the ground. In loose soil the earth
is simply pushed aside, but where the material is too compact for this,
the animal actually eats its way through. The burrow is lined with
soft earth or little stones, and is plugged at the mouth with leaves
or other convenient objects. The animal was found by Darwin to display
distinct intelligence in its manner of drawing leaves into the mouth of
its burrow, seizing them in most cases by their narrow ends, so that
they could be pulled in with as little difficulty as possible. Objects
are generally grasped between the lobe, which overhangs the mouth,
and the lower part of the first segment, the hold being maintained by
a sucking action. The inner end of the burrow is enlarged to allow
the worm room to turn round. At night, the fore part of the body is
protruded in search of food, the tail being generally retained in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
burrow, ready for instantaneous retreat in case of alarm.</p>

<p>The earthworm feeds upon leaves—which are first softened by a fluid
discharged over them, and then sucked into pieces small enough to
be swallowed, for the animal has no jaws—and upon the half-decayed
organic matter which is always present in ordinary soil. The soil
itself is swallowed in large quantities; the nutritious portion is
extracted, and the undigested matter deposited upon the surface of the
ground, near the mouth of the burrow, in the form of <b>castings</b>.
As a result of numerous experiments, Darwin estimated the weight of
castings thus thrown up by earthworms on an acre of land as 15 tons
annually. The following passage is worthy of very careful attention:
“When we behold a wide, turf-covered expanse, we should remember that
its smoothness, on which so much of its beauty depends, is mainly due
to all the inequalities having been slowly levelled by worms. It is a
marvellous reflection that the whole of the superficial mould over any
such expanse has passed, and will again pass, every few years through
the bodies of worms. The plough is one of the most ancient and most
valuable of man’s inventions; but long before he existed the land was
in fact regularly ploughed, and still continues to be thus ploughed
by earthworms. It may be doubted whether there are many other animals
which have played so important a part in the history of the world as
have these lowly organised creatures.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The earthworm lays its eggs in a small cocoon formed by the hardening
of a viscid material which is discharged by a swollen part of the body
called the clitellum, extending from the 32nd to the 37th segments.
After the formation of the cocoon the worm moves backwards, and the
eggs leave the body by small pores on the ventral surface of segment 14,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
as this region passes the cocoon. A small amount of food-material is
also enclosed in the cocoon, and forms a store of nutriment for the
young worms during their early development.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER XXI.<br /><span class="h_subtitle"> FIELD-WORK.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>An animal or a plant must be studied from several points of view before
its manner of life can be understood in any real sense. It must, for
example, be regarded, first, as a complicated piece of machinery, every
part of which is beautifully fitted for the performance of a special
duty; it must also be considered as an <i>individual</i>, having likes or
dislikes—or at least tendencies—which are to some extent peculiar to
itself; finally, it must be considered in its relation to other animals
and plants, and to its surroundings. Field-work is especially concerned
with the last of these methods of study—the observation of living
things under natural conditions,—and this ought constantly to be borne
in mind. To make nature-study a pretext for uprooting locally-rare
plants and robbing birds’ nests is indefensible. The commonest plants
are usually the most instructive, and afford ample material for the
beginner’s experimental work; while the pleasure of finding and
describing (perhaps photographing) a bird’s nest, and of keeping the
eggs and young under observation, is something unknown to the mere
collector of eggs. The life of both plant and animal is sacred in the
eyes of every nature-student worthy of the name. At the same time, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
sentimentality ought to prevent the destruction of undoubtedly noxious
insects and weeds. In general, however, specimens should be killed
only for the purpose of a leisurely examination of structure, which
would otherwise be impossible, or to make needed additions to the
teaching-collection of a school museum.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, collecting is of very doubtful value, except to
experts. Insects and common plants may, however, be collected without
scruple by the beginner, though it is worth remembering that the
most perfect specimens of butterflies and moths are those reared in
captivity from the eggs, larvae, or pupae.</p>

<p>The student is strongly recommended to make a sketch map of some
small area to which he has easy access, and to record upon this the
positions of features of special interest. Such a map may, in the
first instance, be copied on an enlarged scale from an ordnance map of
the neighbourhood, which may be obtained at the local free library.
It will be advisable to duplicate the drawing by means of one of the
many appliances for such work, and to keep one copy each for trees,
flowering plants, birds’ nests, etc.—the position of each object,
or of a well-defined group, being carefully marked by a small number
(<a href="#FIG_237">Fig. 237</a>), and the reference, with the date, being filled
in on the margin. The varying character of the ground—sandy, marshy, clayey,
etc.—should be indicated by diagrammatic shading or colouring. By
following this method the student will more clearly realise that
different plants are dependent upon different conditions of soil,
drainage, etc.; and that, <i>e.g.</i>, plants at home on a bleak moor, in a
hedge, in marshy land or in water respectively, are characteristically
modified so that they can make the best of their special conditions of
life. In this manner he will, almost unconsciously, gain wider views of
the relationships which exist between the facts learned from his more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
detailed observations. It would be a distinct gain to biological
science if field clubs also would adopt some such plan, each member
undertaking to fill in upon his map information of the animal and plant
life of the area allotted to him. The co-operation of various clubs,
and the systematic arrangement of information thus obtained, would
result in a store of knowledge of the highest value.</p>

<p>Many animals are so shy that they can only be approached with
difficulty. In such cases it is especially necessary for the observer
to move quietly and silently, and, when a favourable position is
reached, to remain as motionless as possible, preferably with his
back to the sun. If a field-glass can be obtained it will be of great
assistance, but some practice will probably be required before it can
be used easily.</p>

<p>It is well to start each ramble with some definite object of study in
view—either trees, grasses, flowers, fruits, birds, caterpillars, or
pond life, for example, and to be provided with pill-boxes, bottles,
etc., according to circumstances. A notebook, pencil, pocket knife,
and hand lens should, however, <i>always</i> be carried, and observations
should be recorded on the spot.</p>

<p><b>Pond life.</b>—Practically the only method of gaining a real
knowledge of aquatic organisms is by the help of the aquarium.
Specimens may be obtained by means of a net, or of a small wide-mouthed
bottle tied to a stick. A pickle bottle is convenient for carrying home
the material collected. The conditions of a natural pond should be
imitated as closely as possible in the aquarium. At first, some little
difficulty will probably be found in obtaining the necessary balance
between the animals and plants of the aquarium. When this has been
reached, it will only rarely be necessary to change the water, provided
that dead or sickly specimens are promptly removed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE SCHOOL JOURNEY.</h4>

<p>In the organisation of school journeys so much depends upon local
conditions of various kinds, so much must of necessity be left to the
initiative of the teacher, that it is manifestly impossible here to do
more than enunciate certain general principles. In the first place,
it should be borne in mind constantly that the primary object of the
school journey is the cultivation of habits of thoughtful observation;
and that the chief danger to be guarded against is that out-of-focus
condition into which the mind, like the eye, inevitably falls when
it is concerned with too many things at once. To obviate this danger
the teacher should go over the route in advance, noting carefully the
features, physical and otherwise, which afford material for observation
and investigation by the class. The order in which these features may
be best studied should be decided upon, and a scheme of several visits,
each to be concerned with one special subject of study, can then be
drawn up. Such a preliminary survey should suggest a plan by which
every member of the class may be allotted a definite task—to find
something or do something, or to solve some problem on the spot.</p>

<p>These principles may be best illustrated by a special example, but it
will be obvious that the same ideas, with modifications in detail,
may be applied in any district. The sketch-map (<a href="#FIG_237">Fig. 237</a>)
illustrates a walk through Healey Dell, near Rochdale, Lancashire. The rocks
which are exposed at various places along the route belong to the Carboniferous
formation, and are composed of shale, coal, or millstone grit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>The object of the <b>first journey</b> will be in most cases to
familiarise the class with the “lie of the land” and the most obvious
features of the scenery. As a preparation, lessons should be given
on the points of the compass and the various methods of finding the
direction of the north. The simplest of these is by the use of the
compass: it being remembered that the needle points about 16° to the
west of true north. A second method depends on the fact that at noon
the sun is in the south and that therefore (because the hour hand of
a watch makes two revolutions in the twenty-four hours) the north
and south line approximately bisects the angle between twelve and
the hour hand, if the latter is pointed to the sun when the watch is
horizontal. Incidentally, the method of finding the pole-star might be
also explained to the class. Further, each pupil should be encouraged
to find out how many steps he takes, on the average, in pacing a given
measured distance. If the general direction of the walk is north and
south, as in the example, it will be found best to begin the first
journey at the south end (in this case from Shawclough Station), since
to most children it is easier to conceive of a journey northward than
in any other specified direction. Throughout the ramble constant
reference should be made to the direction of the route and the relative
positions of well-marked features of the landscape. The distances
between certain points should be estimated, and, whenever possible,
measured (by pacing), and notes made by the class. For example, from
Shawclough to Ending the distances and directions are roughly: ¼-mile
W.N.W., ⅓-mile N.N.W., ¼-mile E.N.E. In the first journey also the
class should be made to notice where the ground slopes most and where
least (the direction and angle of slope should be estimated in a few
cases), and the names of neighbouring woods, farms, etc., should be
learnt. The direction of flow of the river and the various bends in
its course should also be noted, and reference made to the route by
which, after joining those of other rivers, its waters ultimately reach
the sea. Afterwards, the pupils should write an account of the journey
and, in the higher classes, should be encouraged to draw a sketch-map,
however crude, from memory.

</div>

<p>Before the <b>second journey</b> each pupil should be provided with
a blank sketch-map of the route. This may, in the first instance, be
copied or traced from the six-inch Ordnance Map, and then duplicated
in large numbers. Only the route and river, and a few of the more
conspicuous landmarks, should be indicated on the maps as given to
the class: details should be filled in, on the spot, by the pupils.
The object of the second journey may conveniently be the study of
the river and its work, and for this purpose it will be advisable to
follow the stream in the direction of its flow. Variations in the
speed of the current, and in the width of the stream and the hardness
of the rocks or banks between which the water flows, should be noted,
and the relations between cause and effect elicited by questioning.
The hardness of the rocks at 4 has prevented the channel from being
widened to a greater extent by the water, and accounts for the rapidity
of the flow. A glass of water collected here is found to contain much
suspended gravel. The considerable loss of weight of bodies in water
is noteworthy, as explaining the great size of the stones which may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
transported by rivers. The scouring action of such stones is shown in
the fine “potholes” at 4 and below the waterfall (<a href="#FIG_238">Fig. 238</a>)
at 10, and has resulted also in the quaint stone portico of the “Fairies’ Chapel”
under the right (west) bank of the river at 7. Again, the difference
in the rates of erosion of hard and soft rocks has had much to do with
forming the waterfalls at 5 and 10. Where the stream is wider and the
flow slower (as at 6 and 9, and below 10), may be noticed sand and mud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
deposits; and where the stream makes a bend it is found that the
slowest flow and the maximum deposit are on the convex bank; while the
concave bank is worn almost vertical (as at 6 and other places) by the
swifter rush of the water, and may be undercut to such an extent as
to cause the bank to give way. In this manner a river is constantly
changing its course. The weir at 13, and the old water-wheel still to
be seen in the ruined mill below, suggest remarks on the motive power
of water, and on the circumstances which may cause the old industries
of a district to be superseded by new ones. Along the rest of the
route the bed of the river is less steep and its banks exhibit less
variation, but they still afford plenty of material for study. The
railway viaduct at 14 and an aqueduct at 16 suggest at least a casual
reference to the derivation of the terms. Before the pupils are asked
to write a “composition” on the ramble, a revision lesson on the
features noticed should be given, and the accuracy of the entries on
the sketch-maps checked by comparison with an enlarged map drawn by the
teacher, or with a large “parish plan” of the Ordnance Survey, on the
scale of 25.3 inches to the mile.</p>

<p>It will be well to devote two or more journeys to the study of the
<b>trees</b> along the route. One journey should be taken in the
spring, before the leaves are out, and another in the summer, when
the foliage is well developed. It is far better to study three kinds
of trees in some detail than to risk confusion at the beginning by
attending to a dozen. In Healey Dell the commonest trees are beech,
oak, and sycamore, and these serve admirably as an introduction to tree
lore. If the first tree-journey be taken in the summer, the leaves of
some three abundant species should be compared and contrasted, and
each pupil should secure good specimens, to be drawn and preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
afterwards. The presence of a little bud in the “axil” (the upper angle
between leaf and twig) of most of the leaves should be pointed out by
the teacher; and since the arrangement of the buds (and therefore of
the subsequent branches of the twig) thus depends on the positions
of the leaves, this last point is of considerable interest. In the
sycamore, the leaves are in pairs at right angles to each other; in
the beech and oak they are single and alternate, but much more crowded
together in the oak than in the beech. The bark of the three trees is
equally distinctive, and with the method of branching (obscured when
the foliage is thick) serves to identify the trees from a distance in
the winter. In winter and spring the interest of a tree is centred
in its buds, and there are few things which more richly repay study.
In spring, attention should also be given to the flowers—generally
arranged in catkins—of common trees. Separate sketch-maps should
be used as records of the positions of the more notable trees or
plantations along the route. Any tendency to vandalism on the part
of the pupils by tearing off branches should, of course, be sternly
repressed; especially interesting twigs should, on occasion, be <i>cut</i>
off by the teacher only, for later study.</p>

<p>There is much diversity of opinion as to the way in which
<b>flowers</b> may be best studied in a limited number of school
journeys. In most cases it will perhaps be impracticable to attempt
more than teaching the names and calling attention to the habitat of
the commonest. This, though a necessary introduction to the subject,
tends to degenerate into a mere exercise of the memory, and in itself
possesses little educational value. It should be supplemented by a
detailed examination of a typical flower—say a buttercup—and by the
explanation of the work of each part. Once the pupil has understood
that the single duty of a flower is the production of healthy seeds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
and has been led to notice how, by the aid of ingenious devices, the
up-to-date plants have learnt to call in the aid of insects, while the
more conservative families still rely on the aid of the wind, he will
be eager to discover for himself “how the thing works.” With young
children it is folly to attempt any but the very broadest principles
of classification of flowers; but quite young children can appreciate
the advance from flowers without petals, through flowers with separate
petals, to those with petals united to form a tube (thus restricting
the nectar more and more to “useful” insects); and so understand the
advantage which a primrose has over a buttercup, and a buttercup over
an oak flower.</p>

<p>At least one journey should be given, in the autumn, to the study of
the dispersion of <b>fruits and seeds</b>. The pupils should provide
themselves with empty match-boxes or chip pill-boxes. In this ramble
the class may with advantage be divided into four groups. Group A will
collect examples of fruits and seeds which are dispersed by the wind;
Group B, of fruits which by means of hooks or otherwise become attached
to the hides of grazing animals, and are carried far from the place
where they grow; Group C will collect fruits which tempt animals to
eat them for the sake of sweet pulp (in these cases the pupils should
find out <i>a</i> how the fruit is made conspicuous, <i>b</i> how the seeds
themselves are protected from being injured by the animals); while
Group D will search for specimens of plants which sow their own seeds.</p>

<p>There still remains abundant material for study in this walk, and
mention only can be made of the sticklebacks, frog-spawn, snails,
caddis-worms, dragon fly larvae, blood-worms—of the “things creeping
innumerable, both small and great beasts”—which have been found in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
river, ponds, and wells along our route, and have been used to stock
the aquarium; of the rabbits and birds; of the nests of ants and wild
bees and wasps; of a certain blackberry bush (31) rich in interesting
leaves; and of a thousand and one other things which, under the
guidance of a judicious leader, may well be the means of teaching
children to see what they look at and to think about what they see. For
this is the first and last object of the school journey.</p>

<p>14. Describe the life-history of a fern so far as it can be observed
by the naked eye and with the aid of a pocket lens.</p>

<p>15. Describe, with the help of drawings, the work of a bee in its
mode both of collecting pollen and honey and of fertilising flowers.</p>

<p>16. Give a short account of the structure of a bird’s wing. How are
the wings made use of during flight?</p>

<p>17. Give an account of some simple experiments you would employ to
demonstrate the phenomena of respiration in animals and plants.

<p>1. Describe with the aid of a drawing the various structures seen by
means of a pocket lens in a section across the middle region of a grain
of wheat.</p>

<p>2. How would you measure the rate of transpiration of water from a
small plant or a leafy stem?</p>

<p>3. How can it be shown that the root responds to external influences
of moisture, light and gravity?</p>

<p>4. Give a brief account of the function of the green leaf in the
nutrition of plants.</p>

<p>5. Compare by drawings the leaves of broad bean and garden pea. Then
discuss the means by which the two plants obtain mechanical support.</p>

<p>6. When the bulb of a thermometer is placed in a jar of soaked and
germinating seeds, what temperature change is observed? Explain the
cause of this.</p>

<p>7. Describe experiments which show in what respects the air is
affected in composition by passing through the lungs.</p>

<p>8. Describe with the help of drawings the structure of the
flowers of the hazel or willow and show how they are adapted for
cross-pollination.</p>

<p>9. What is meant by root pressure, and how would you demonstrate it?
Illustrate your answer by drawings.</p>

<p>10. What are the conditions of the soil which make it a suitable
medium for healthy root-action and vigorous plant growth? Conversely
under what conditions of soil would the plant fail to thrive or die?

stages of the life-history.</p>

<p>2. Where and when do you find Frog’s eggs? Of what use is the jelly
with which they are surrounded?</p>

<p>3. How does the Tadpole swim, and how does the Frog swim? How does
the Frog jump, and how does it catch a fly?</p>

<p>4. Contrast the characters of the mouth (including teeth if present)
in the Frog, Bird, Cat, Rabbit and Sheep.</p>

<p>5. Describe the characteristic modes of locomotion in the Bird, Dog,
Rabbit and Bat, and point out any peculiarities of the skeleton which
are related to these habits.</p>

<p>6. Describe the heart of the Sheep, and account so far as you can
for any differences you can point out between the various chambers.</p>

<p>7. In what way are bees useful to flowers? Explain in any one
example you choose what happens when a bee visits the flower.</p>

<p>8. Describe the roots of a pea or bean. What importance do you
attach to the different parts you mention?</p>

<p>9. What is starch? How would you show whether or not it was present
in a leaf? What conditions are necessary in order that the leaf may
produce it?</p>

<p>10. Describe the fruit of <i>either</i> the Sycamore <i>or</i> the Poppy,

<p class="f120">BOOK I.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p><i>Schoolmaster.</i>—“All the facts are presented in the same lucid and
simple style, so that very young readers can understand them. The book
will carry health and happiness with it, so that we hope it will find
its way into many a school for boys as well as for girls.”</p>

<p><i>Head Teacher.</i>—“Full of good advice that should be within reach
of all.”</p>

<p><i>Lancet.</i>—“The book is divided into 30 lessons: the subject matter
of each is well arranged and simply expressed.... Can only do good to
those who read it.”</p>

<p><i>Educational News.</i>—“It is appropriately simple in diction,
carefully arranged, and quite sufficiently full of information for the
young people whom it is meant to serve as a Class Reader.... A special
word of praise is due to the photographic illustrations.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i>—“We have looked carefully through the pages of this
little book, and believe it will be exceedingly helpful to teachers.
It is simply written. Each lesson is practical, concise, and
interesting.”</p>

<p><i>Teachers’ Aid.</i>—“The physiology necessary to a proper appreciation
of the laws of health is delightful in the simplicity of its treatment,
while the simple way of pressing home the truths of hygiene in a
language suited to the capacity of young children is considerably
enhanced by the novel and original illustrations which consist of
photographs specially taken for the purpose. To teachers taking the
subject in school we can most cordially recommend this reader.”</p>

<p><i>Child Life.</i>—“From the scientific point of view the matter is very
valuable, and such as every boy and girl should know before they leave
school.”</p>
</div>

<p class="f120">BOOK II.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p><i>Schoolmaster.</i>—“This is a capital little book, attractively written
and well illustrated.” <i>Child Life.</i>—“The book is an accurate and easy
reader, provided with suitable illustrations.”</p>

<p><i>Bookseller.</i>—“Illustrations are provided in profusion, and the book
should certainly prove most useful and attractive for all those who
have to teach or study the important matters with which it deals.”</p>

<p><i>Head Teacher.</i>—“Is clearly and well written by practical men who
understand the capacities of children.”</p>

<p><i>Lancet.</i>—“Their book will be of real service to those teachers who
are empowered to impart such instruction. The pictures are well planned
to catch a child’s attention.”</p>

frog should be made and exhibited to the class. Detailed instructions
for such a dissection will be found in Marshall’s <i>The Frog</i> (Smith,
Elder &amp; Co.) or in Huxley and Martin’s <i>Elementary Practical Biology</i>
(Macmillan). The frog’s heart continues to beat for some time after the
death of the animal, and may be shown as an illustration of the next
section of this chapter. Teachers who are unskilled in dissection may
obtain prepared dissections, mounted skeletons, etc., from Newmann &amp;

amnion originates, early in the second day, as a double fold of the
yolk-surface in front of the embryo. Similar folds arise round the
sides and tail, forming a low wall (<a href="#FIG_187">Fig. 187</a>, <i>A</i>);
the folds gradually grow over the embryo (<a href="#FIG_187">Fig. 187</a>, <i>B</i>) until, during the
fourth day, they meet (<a href="#FIG_187">Fig. 187</a>, <i>C</i>) and enclose it in a protective
transparent bag, containing a watery fluid.</p>
